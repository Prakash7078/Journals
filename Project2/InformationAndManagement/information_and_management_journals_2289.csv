A comparison of three computer cursor control devices: pen on horizontal tablet, mouse and keyboard","Volume 27, Issue 6", Issue 6,"It might seem likely that an electronic pen manipulated on a desk top tablet would elicit better performance and greater user preference than other cursor control devices. This paper presents four experiments that examine this hypothesis by comparing speed, accuracy, and preference for a pen device with the two most widely used cursor control devices (mouse and keyboard) in a drawing (graphics) environment. In the context of these experiments pen use was never significantly faster than mouse, while both pen and mouse use were always significantly faster than the keyboard. In contrast, keyboard use was always more error free than the mouse, which in turn was always more error free than the pen. These error differences were significant in a majority of the cases. Subjects expressed preference for the mouse in general work (significant). For highly accurate work, subject preference was for the keyboard (significant).",[],Richard Coll,TYOUNG@HSLC.ORG,"Gwynedd-Mercy College, Gwynedd Valley, PA 19437, USA"

National infrastructure diffusion and the U.S. information super highway","Volume 27, Issue 6", Issue 6,"Governments are playing an increasingly important role in the development of national information infrastructure (NII). This paper explores one example in the United States' effort to build an “Information Super Highway”; which may determine the way its citizens create and communicate knowledge in the next century. This NII will provide widespread access to private and public networks capable of transmitting data, voice, text, images and video. It will consist of user information appliances, local area networks, access networks, and regional and national networks with speeds of hundreds of gigabits per second. In the course of its development the U.S. Information Super Highway's scope has been broadened to include high-speed connections to public schools, corporations, and eventually homes. The building of national information infrastructure, raises important issues of ownership, management, operation, use, and economics. A diffusion model of NII is presented to address these implementation issues.",[],William J. Kettinger,N/A,"College of Business Administration, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208, USA"

There was also a significant difference in the dependent measures between large verbal groups and large electronic brainstorming groups. Results suggest that the benefits of electronic brainstorming are more pronounced with larger groups than with smaller groups.",[],Jeanette Martin,N/A,"Department of Management and Marketing School of Business Administration, University of Mississippi, University, MS 38677, USA"

The effect of information presentation on decision making: A cost-benefit analysis","Volume 27, Issue 2", Issue 2,"Cost-benefit theory is presented as a cohesive way of organizing knowledge about information presentation. This theory suggests that decision makers change strategy so that they minimize the joint cost of effort and error in making a decision. Here we apply two aspects of the theory. First, the theory of cognitive fit applies to decision making on fairly simple tasks of information acquisition and simple evaluation. Certain strategies (in this case problem-solving “processes”) will dominate alternative ones when the problem representation matches the nature of the decision-making task. The processes are effectively controlled, resulting in maximum accuracy at minimum cost. Second, the more traditional view is applied to decision making on more complex tasks, where a number of appropriate strategies may be available, with trade-offs between error and effort. Both aspects of the theory are tested by evaluating results of published graphs versus tables studies. The theory presented successfully explains the results of the majority of these studies. Further, the paper examines the implications of the cost-benefit framework for the design of decision support systems (DSS) and the notion of DSS restrictiveness. Rather than addressing the role of strategy alone in investigating the effectiveness of different display formats, researchers in behavioral decision making are encouraged to also address the role of problem-solving processes.",[],Iris Vessey,ixv1@psuvm.psu.edu,"Smeal College of Business Administration, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA"

The inertial impact of culture on IT implementation","Volume 27, Issue 1", Issue 1,"Many researchers suggest that information technology (IT) implementation can be used to facilitate organizational reengineering. However, there are several factors that foster organizational inertia and inhibit such change. When an IT conflicts with an organization's culture, the implementation of that IT is resisted in two ways. The first may result in implementation failure by undermining the analysis and design process, underutilizing the system once implemented, and/or sabotaging the implemented system. The second adapts the IT during implementation or use so that conflicts with the existing culture are reduced. Both of these reduce the potential of IT implementation to engender organizational change. The impact of culture on organizational change is well known and documented in the organizational literature. This paper demonstrates some theoretical linkages among various cultures and different ITs. A theoretical case is therefore made concerning the inertial impact of culture on IT implementation.",[],Randolph B.

Lessons relevant to managing new information technologies are high- lighted from each of these four areas. These show that managers should not make a commitment to a specific technological platform too early in the process, that there is a need for a vision that goes beyond the original business problem that triggered the consideration of new ITs, that the development of new technological solutions often require separate organizations cooperating in strategic partnerships, that the adoption of new information technologies should be accompanied by a planned marketing, publicity, and educational effort, that a new organizational entity may be needed to ensure sufficient attention to the diffusion of the adopted technology, and that a vendor should be selected to meet both the immediate and strategic goals for utilizing the new technology.",[],Boon Siong Neo,N/A,"Information Management Research Centre, School of Accountancy and Business, Nanyang Technological University, Nanyang Avenue, Singapore 2263"

A conceptual planning model, which identifies the various components and links of the IS planning system, is used as a framework for evaluation. To validate the framework, a research model is developed and empirically validated using data collected from a survey of planning practices in organization. The results show that information inputs and planning resources are significantly related to the quality of the IS planning process, and quality of integration mechanisms moderates the relationship between information input and the quality of the planning process.

Responses were obtained from 297 people, of which 72% were senior IS managers. The R.O.C. respondents are equally concerned about management and technology related issues both currently and in the future (in the next 3–5 years). With respect to management related issues, IS strategic planning, goals alignment, and competitive advantages are currently (and will continue to be) on the top list of IS managers. Respondents also perceive that top management support is (and will continue to be) crucial for the IS department to achieve its mission. They believe that there is a continual need to close the communication gap between end users and the IS department. In terms of technology related issues, IT infrastructure, systems integration, security and control, and software development quality, are currently important, and they are expected to become more important in future. Computerization of routine work was found to be currently important, however its relative importance is expected to decrease.

Batch-mode processing suffers from many limitations, the principal ones being that: (i) users are denied real-time access to their money, and that (ii) a user's banking privileges cannot be extended — a facility that is increasingly being demanded by users.

Is user satisfaction a valid measure of system effectiveness?","Volume 26, Issue 3", Issue 3,"User satisfaction (US) is often used as a surrogate measure of information system effectiveness. If an effective system is defined as one that adds value to the firm, then an effective system must have some positive influence on user behavior (i.e., improve productivity, decision making, etc.). Advocates of US argue that there is theoretical support for linking attitudes (i.e., satisfaction) and behavior in the psychology literature. At the same time, there is evidence of increasing employment of US questionnaires in firms as a measure of system effectiveness. Yet there is surprisingly little information systems research linking user satisfaction with user behavior. In this study, measures of user satisfaction and system affected behavior are taken for an indirect and a direct user group of the same information system in 39 organizations. Results indicate that a relationship does exist between satisfaction and behavior for both user groups.",[],,,

Factors affecting the implementation outcome of a mainframe software package: A longitudinal study","Volume 26, Issue 3", Issue 3,"A framework for predicting the likely short and long term outcome of an organization's effort to implement an off-the-shelf software package is proposed and then field tested. The framework considers the initial fit of the proposed system from the perspectives of both the manager/end users and members of their information systems staffs. Due to moderate collinearity among the independent variables, the field test data were analyzed using ridge regression. It was concluded that the short term success of an implementation effort was determined mostly by three factors, as viewed from the perspective of the potential user of the application. Those three factors, in order, were: the relative advantage of the application to the user, the compatibility of the application with the work norms of the user, and the applications lack of complexity or difficulty in use by the potential adopter. Over the long term, while these factors remained significant for continued success, it was important that the application also not be overly complex from the perspective of the information systems support staff. These findings lead to a strategy for software package evaluation and implementation. First, a thorough understanding of the impact of an application on its intended end-users is critical to successful implementation. This understanding is similar to the insight gained from the systems analysis process in custom software development.
