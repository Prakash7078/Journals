Furthermore, the participants were highly satisfied with the electronic meeting process and perceived a high level of group cohesiveness during the meetings. Observation of group interaction processes during the electronic meetings and post-meeting interviews further suggest that (1) EMS do not replace but augment verbal communications in a face-to-face meeting. This increases the volume of information generated and communicated during the meetings; (2) user interface and ease of use of EMS software can compensate for low levels of participant computer literacy and for typing skills; (3) electronic meeting systems increase participants' concentration and enjoyment of the task; this may lead to increased creativity and productivity.

Information systems development and communicative action theory☆","Volume 25, Issue 2", Issue 2,Effective communication among developers and users underlies the success of designing computer-based information systems (CBIs). We propose that Habermas' theory of communicative action is useful for investigating the CBIS developmental process. To support this we analyze our experiences in constructing two different DSSs. Communicative action theory is used to uncover and explain the unexpected failure of one and the unanticipated success of another. The two case studies show how appropriate communicative action can be used to respond to design uncertainty and user resistance. The cases also suggest that a lack of appropriate communicative action during the developmental process can cause premature system failure. We perceive the problems in constructing these DSSs to be representative of the difficulties experienced in developing different CBISs. This implies that insight arising from investigating the cases using communicative action theory may also be useful in designing other CBISs.,[],L.Douglas Smith,N/A,"University of Missouri-St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA"

It can be used to reveal citation patterns and thus results stemming from the analysis, including co-citation patterns and groupings of researchers, even reveal paradigmatic schools within a certain field. In this article, twelve major MIS journals — six European and six American — are studied to find out whether there are any differences in author selection and referencing patterns. It was discovered that the American MIS community is much more self-sustaining than the European one, which relies heavily on work by American authors. This points either to the superiority of the American MIS community, or the under-appreciation of foreign research, or possibly both. On the European side, the result might be interpreted as a sign of low-quality research, lack of self-esteem and pride, or again both. Clear differences between the editorial policy of the journals can be discerned: some journals accept the American hegemony; some try to maintain a balance between contributions from different countries; and some favour European research.",[],Reima Suomi,N/A,"Turku School of Economics and Business Administration, Turku, Finland"

Variations in users' definitions of an information system","Volume 24, Issue 4", Issue 4,"Information systems (IS) are complex and abstract. When users are asked to evaluate “the system,” there is no guarantee that they will all be thinking about the same object. Laboratory research has shown that differences in the way an IS is defined affect users' evaluations of the system. If such variations exist in the field (that is, if the term “the system” invokes different images in the minds of different users), they might affect user evaluations. This paper reports a study of variations in users' definitions of a human resource information system. There were significant variations in opinions about what the IS was. Most users were certain that their definitions were correct, even though they disagreed with one another. Users with more IS-related expertise included fewer objects in the system than less expert users. The findings have implications for MIS research and management. In particular, developers should provide each user with a definition of an IS from the time of their first contact with the system. The definition should be aligned with the organizational responsibilities of the developers.",[],Kieran Mathieson,N/A,"Oakland University, Rochester, MI 48309-4401, USA"

A comparative evaluation of the impact of electronic and voice mail on organizational communication☆","Volume 24, Issue 1", Issue 1,"Communication in scheduled and unscheduled meetings, over the telephone and in face-to-face encounters consumes the majority of a manager's time.

This paper reports on the results of an exploratory study that compares two of the most prevalent communication technologies: Voice and electronic mail. Based on the findings of a questionnaire completed by 68 users of both voice mail and electronic mail from 12 organizations, cross-media comparisons are made with respect to scope of communication, patterns of communication, communication tasks and message content. The findings indicate that E-mail is viewed as a medium that has a significant impact on how individuals communicate in an organization.

Diagnosis of an information system failure: A framework and interpretive process","Volume 23, Issue 5", Issue 5,"In diagnosing an episode of information system application failure, the IS professional and others doing the analysis face two challenges: (1) relevant data must be identified, collected, and organized; and (2) the data must be analyzed and interpreted to form a coherent picture of the perspectives, actions, and events which resulted in the troubled or failed system. This article provides a diagnostic framework and interpretive process for performing a diagnosis. The premise underlying the diagnostic framework is that an information system is a social system has uses information technology. The social and technical dimensions in the diagnosis of an information system are represented in a two-dimensional framework.

It draws on a random sample of 149 Australian enterprises. Based on computer-use in fourteen different functions, cluster analysis produced two main groups: i.e., organizations with high and low computer-usage profiles. Analysis of variance between these groups revealed that organizations with high usage profile tend to be larger and privately owned. Structurally, these organizations tend to be more formalized, more departmentalized and flatter in management levels. They tend, however, to be relatively less centralized. Multiple regressions within each of these groups revealed that contextual characteristics (such as size and ownership) and the varying extent of computer use in different functions had different impact on structure within each group.",[],Rachid Zeffane,mgmz@cc.newcastle.edu.au,"University of Newcastle, Newcastle, NSW, Australia"

For even though the politics of informatics may result in mandatory regulation of all activities associated with this and related fields or just in a set of recommendations, national informatics policies tend to develop common attitudes to those situations that arise when a country faces the challenge of developing computing systems and their applications. This paper discusses some typical situations and presents the problems and questions that arise when developing a national policy on informatics.",[],Víctor L.

AUTOREF: A deductive database for automatic referee selection","Volume 22, Issue 6", Issue 6,"A central function in processing papers submitted for publication is that of finding suitable referees. Referees should be knowledgeable, have sufficient time, and be thorough and prompt in their reviews. Sometimes, specific knowledge, such as a known conflict of interest, will have a bearing on the process. While the record-keeping associated with submissions is often automated, the referee selection process is still done manually. We describe a prototype deductive database named AUTOREF, implemented in PROLOG, that can provide automated assistance in this selection process. AUTOREF strives to find the best referees, failing which, it progressively relaxes requirements to find the most suitable available ones. As a last resort, it goes into manual code. The editorial activities supported by AUTOREF are generic, and could be customized for most specific requirements. Automated assistance for referee selection might further improve quality and efficiency of the editorial process.",[],Amitava Dutta,N/A,"University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA"

The use of expert systems in the healthcare industry","Volume 22, Issue 4", Issue 4,"The large, enormously complex expert systems (ES) such as MYCIN, ONCOCIN, and INTERNIST raised the expectations of many that artificial intelligence (AI) technology would have a significant impact on the everyday practice of medicine. A rather eclectic literature search reveals that while hundreds of applied expert systems have been prototyped, these have not led to a groundswell of interest among either practicing physicians or healthcare administrators. To account for this apparent failure of expert systems to deliver on their promised capabilities, three key factors are explored: physician disinterest' the low priority assigned to Al among healthcare information systems executives; and the relatively new competitive market pressures affecting health services delivery. A domain of the healthcare industry where ES and knowledge-based technology has taken hold, i.e. the managed care/utilization review arena, is described. This new application of ES technology has the potential to influence standards of medical practice through “medical necessity criteria” embedded in the knowledge base, and to disseminate key findings from research on medical treatment outcomes.

IT structures for the 1990s: organisation of IT functions in large companies: A survey","Volume 22, Issue 3", Issue 3,"How is the information technology (IT) function organised in large multi-business companies? A two stage postal survey investigated the distribution of responsibility for IT activities and the role of the corporate IT function in 50 times 100 companies. Results indicate that the vast majority of large companies have federal IT management structures - distributed responsibility for IT combined with some central functional leadership or guidance. Four approaches to the organisation and management of IT activities were identified: Centralised, Strategic leadership, Strategic guidance, and Decentralised. In companies with a Strategic Leadership IT management style, the corporate centre has a dominant influence over IT activities and is predicted to retain its dominance in the future. In companies with a Strategic Guidance IT management style, divisional and business unit managements hold most responsibility for IT activities and the role of the centre is predicted to decline in importance. Using responses from general management executives, results reveal that the degree of centralisation of corporate management functions and the importance placed on the central managerial planning and control roles are correlated with IT management style.",[],Stephen L.

A causal path model of the overall user attitudes toward the MIS function: The case of user information satisfaction","Volume 22, Issue 2", Issue 2,"MIS literature has identified the importance of user attitude toward MIS, which is measured by user information satisfaction (UIS). However, poor user evaluation of the function remains a problem in many organizations. In this paper we examine factors that may influence UIS and their relative influence or importance. The paper evaluates some alternate causal path models of UIS involving traditional factors such as quality of information products, knowledge and involvement, and attitude towards EDP staff and service, along with three new factors: equity in the allocation of MIS resources, role conflict, and role ambiguity. Data from a cross-sectional survey involving 324 users is employed to evaluate the causal path models through path analysis. Equity was found to be the most important variable influencing UIS. The importance of equity identified here supports the existence of struggle for obtaining scarce MIS resources reported by other researchers. The results also highlight a need for the establishment of mechanisms and structural arrangements for fair allocation of resources.",[],Kailash Joshi,N/A,"School of Business Administration, University of Missouri-St. Louis, St. Louis, MI 63121, USA"

It is often claimed to be particularly useful in the development of systems to support executive decision making, which by definition deal with unstructured business problems. Data from 109 top executives and 34 MIS managers from 40 organizations are used to identify executives' problems with information systems and the alternative and complimentary solutions to these problems. Prototyping is rated quite highly by MIS managers as a solution to many executive problems. The benefits of prototyping suggested in the literature are clearly borne out by the study.",[],Jayant V.

Managing J.

Artificial intelligence based simulation in the design of a GDSS idea generation tool","Volume 21, Issue 5", Issue 5,"Little research has been conducted on the software engineering design problems of group decision support systems (GDSS).

Selecting a requirement determination methodology-contingency approach revisited","Volume 21, Issue 5", Issue 5,"Previous research proposed a contingency approach to selecting a particular requirement determination methodology because of the uncertainty that exists in defining application/ organizational information requirements. Recent research has shown that organizations use information to reduce uncertainty, to resolve equivocality, or both. Since the nature of information used to reduce uncertainty is different from that used to resolve equivocality, it is necessary to decide which is needed before starting to design the future system. This paper presents a three step approach to selecting a requirement determination methodology. The first step calls for assessment of the degree of uncertainty and equivocality present in the application. Based on this, an appropriate information acquisition strategy is identified.

Drawing on these differences, regression applications occuring over the last decade are examined. Evidence gathered by this study suggests that these differences are often not acknowledged, leading to results that are frequently suboptimal and at times erroneous.",[],Marius A.

Organization and management of information systems functions: Comparative study of selected organizations in Bahrain☆","Volume 21, Issue 2", Issue 2,"This study evaluates and compares the organizational structure, management and communications strategy of IS functions in selected organizations in Bahrain. The IS activities fit, with some variations, into Zmud's traditional IS roles model. The IS departments of two of the organizations maintain a successful project and work oriented matrix structure for software development functions and the usual functional structures for computer operation units. Two other organizations use the traditional functional structures, as they are primarily involved in acquisition, implementation, and maintenance of overseas developed application software. These operations are carried out with difficulty, as they become fire-fighting. The four organizations were fairly successful in maintaining the desired communication within their various IS sub-functions Some of them face difficulties in appointing and retaining qualified and experienced staff. With some exceptions, the organizations maintain no established steering committee that can formulate IS policy and plan and prepare project selection and resource utilization guidelines. The relationships of each IS department with its users during routine activities were satisfactory. Each organization encourages the user departments in using PC-based fourth generation software tools. But these organizations are a long way from adopting Zmud's evolving IS roles and organizational model. The findings also sudggested that Nolan's growth stages are applicable to these firms.",[],Emdad H. Khan,N/A,"Department of Computer Science, The University of Bahrain, Isa Town, Bahrain"

A DSS approach for implementing an online retail banking system: A case study","Volume 21, Issue 2", Issue 2,"This article is based on the author's experience in supervising the development and implementation of a distributed online retail banking decision support system (DSS) for Arab National Bank (ANB) in Riyadh - Saudi Arabia. The system emphasizes the different components and characteristics of DSS in terms of flexibility, responsiveness, ease of use, interactive interface, and the use of an adaptive process for design and implementation. The system provides branch management with facilities for direct control and monitoring of branch operations and for immediate access to information needed for decision making. Customer service was drastically reduced from an average of 30 minutes per transaction to a one minute average. The prototyping approach made it possible to solicit user participation and to facilitate the training and conversion processes which in turn eased the way for smooth and successful implementation.",[],Mohammed H.

Identifying organizational culture clash in MIS implementation: When is it worth the effort?","Volume 21, Issue 2", Issue 2,"A prerequisite to succeeding in MIS implementation is analysis of both technical and organizational validity prior to implementation. In this paper we show that of the various organizational validity aspects, organizational culture presents a particularly difficult challenge. On the one hand, without a match between the culture of an organization and the cultural assumptions embedded within the MIS, a costly implementation failure is likely. On the other hand, a significant effort to detect a cultural clash prior to implementation might not be worthwhile for each and every MIS. This paper identifies two characteristics of the MIS, culture content and predictability of outcome, as relevant to the question of when is an early detection of a culture clash worth the effort. The following general guidelines are offered: for MISs characterized by high culture content and low predictability of outcome, an effort to detect contrasting orientations of culture prior to implementation is justified; for MISs characterized by low culture content and high predictability of outcome, it is relatively safe to avoid early detection.

Usability of knowledge-based systems: Beyond technical feasibility","Volume 21, Issue 1", Issue 1,"Designing a usable computer-based information system is a challenging task. Information systems are costly and require a great organizational commitment. Knowledge-based systems are no exception. To be able to extract domain expertise and encode it in a computer system is not all there is to do. This paper advocates a user-centered view in knowledge-based systems design and development. The ultimate user's task and the level of representation suitable for it must be incorporated and accounted for in designing such expert systems. This therefore calls for a shift from “efficiency” to “adequacy” of the problem solution, a shift of concern from the requirements of the “computer” to those of “user”.

Managers are frequently overwhelmed by the rising tide of useless information that crosses their desks and often hides the occasional truly significant document. The control of written information is often based implicity on the Library Model; that is, the control of written information in business is much like the management of books in a library. This article discusses what the difficulties are in applying the Library Model to business information systems and offers a more appropriate model for business to manage their written information.",[],Michael D.

Consultant engagement for computer system selection: A pro-active client role in small businesses","Volume 20, Issue 2", Issue 2,"Because of their limited number of senior positions and fewer alternative career paths, small businesses have a more difficult time attracting and retaining skilled information systems (IS) staff and are thus dependent upon external expertise. Small businesses are particularly dependent on outside expertise when first computerizing. Because small businesses suffer from severe financial constraints, it is often difficult to justify the cost of custom software. Hence, for many small businesses, engaging a consultant to help with identifying suitable packaged software and related hardware, is their first critical step toward computerization. This study explores the importance of pro-active client involvement when engaging a consultant to assist with computer system selection in small businesses. Client involvement throughout consultant engagement is found to be integral to project success and frequently lacking due to mis-conceptions of small businesses regarding their role. Small businesses often overestimate the impact of consultant and vendor support in achieving succesful computer system selection and implementation. For consultant engagement to be successful, the process must be viewed as being directed toward the achievement of specific organizational results where the client accepts responsibility for direction of the process.",[],Guy G.

An assessment of DSS performance: The impact of utilization and closure","Volume 20, Issue 2", Issue 2,"The information technology described is a U.S. Coast Guard vessel movement reporting system, known as a vessel traffic service. This group decision support system aids vessel operators to navigate a treacherous portion of the Mississippi River from the Gulf of Mexico to Baton Rouge. Voluntary participants provide inputs for a computer simulated tracking of vessels and receive relevant information about marine traffic from the system. Two time series regression models explain changes in system performance as specified by objective, quantitative criterion variables known as critical success factors. One model relates changes in the safety criteria (vessel accidents) with utilization of the vessel traffic service, and the other regression explains changes in system utilization with factors which dictate use. Despite initial criticism that this decision support system was technically flawed because it did not use radar or television to establish the real-time presence and progress of vessel traffic, this research provides evidence that the vessel traffic service has been very effective in reducing vessel accidents on the lower Mississippi River. The findings suggest that not only are utilization levels of these systems important, but also their very presence is crucial for vessels wishing to avail themselves of the service. The presence of the system provided measurable benefits, while the absence of the vessel traffic system precipitated higher accident rates through lower user participation after its eventual reinstatement.",[],Louis A.

Security concerns of system users: A study of perceptions of the adequacy of security☆","Volume 20, Issue 1", Issue 1,"In the past several years, a number of researchers have raised the issue of the level of security concern among system users, suggesting that security may be undervalued in both centralized and decentralized IS departments, and among IS staff as well as end-users. Since protective measures often require significant managerial vigilance, an appropriate level of awareness and concern may be a prerequisite for adequate security protection. Given its importance, there is a need for a better understanding of what leads to security concern. This paper focuses on users' perceptions about the security of their systems. Based on previous work on individuals' attitudes and beliefs about IS and IS environments, it is hypothesized that a user's concern about security is a function of three different constructs: industry risk, company actions, and individual awareness. The study tests the main assertions of the model, using a cross-sample comparison of perceptions from two different survey instruments. The first sample used 570 randomly selected DPMA members.

The information loop as a general analytic view","Volume 20, Issue 1", Issue 1,"Current predominant views of information systems (IS) are motivated more by design and engineering aims, than they are by the aims of empirical study. To better support the latter, we advance a general analytic view based on the notion of “information loops” (I-loops) in organizations. An I-loop is understood to be anchored in an information context (I-context) from which it is pulled out conceptually for examination. Information systems (IS) are formal I-loops comprised of information acquisition (I-acquisition), information processing (I-processing), and information employment (I-employment) process. An information store (I-store) provides data, models, and procedures in support of I-processing. We show the usefulness of the I-loop view for empirical studies, both for basic IS description and for IS problem diagnosis and treatment.",[],E.Burton Swanson,N/A,"Anderson Graduate School of Management, University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024, U.S.A."

Draining the swamp: Defining strategic use of the information systems resource☆","Volume 20, Issue 1", Issue 1,There has been a great deal of discussion in information systems (IS) journals and elsewhere on strategic use of the IS resource. These discussions describe very diferent views of what is meant by strategic IS use. This paper clarifies the concept of strategic use of the IS resource and identifies the issues to address in using the IS resource as a strategic business factor. A model is presented to help distinguish among the differing uses of the term “strategic use of the IS resource” and to guide executives and IS managers in choosing among the many alternatives in using IS strategically.,[],Ronald B.

Reorganization of the work system for successful information systems implementation: A case study","Volume 19, Issue 4", Issue 4,"This paper presents a case study of two attempts to implement a computer based materials management system in a large engineering company. It presents the details of the failure of the first attempt, and an analysis of the problems encountered in the first attempt.

The analysis of the two implementation attempts suggests the important role of personnel with functional expertise and cross-functional business perspective on design teams. This should facilitate the integrated work-information system design stressed in this paper. The case study illustrates the nature of interrelationships between the work system and the information system and the dependence of the information system on the work system for successful operation. Thus, in some instances the need for reorganization of the work system for successful implementation is highlighted. The analysis also identifies the role of top management in creating the necessary organizational structures for involving users and assigning the responsibility for the success of the implementation to them. The paper also makes recommendations for the development of systems designers through appropriate recruitment, training, and job rotation programs.

Proponents argue that GDSS can improve group decisions by supporting face-to-face conferencing, remote site teleconferencing, and remote/local computer conferencing. Emerging capabilities in telecommunications technology have enhanced these prospects. A survey of 135 randomly-selected organizations determined that GDSS are gradually being incorporated into the organization's information system (IS) portfolio. Apparently organizations are increasing their commitment to GDSS and current implementations are heaviest in the remote/ local computer conferencing arena, especially in electronic mail.

Utilizing GDSS technology: Final report on a recent empirical study","Volume 18, Issue 5", Issue 5,"In recent years, Group Decision Support Systems (GDSS) technology has attracted considerable research interest. Proponents argue that GDSS can improve group decisions by supporting face-to-face conferencing, remote site teleconferencing, and remote/local computer conferencing. Emerging capabilities in telecommunications technology have enhanced these prospects. A survey of 135 randomly-selected organizations determined that GDSS are gradually being incorporated into the organization's information system (IS) portfolio. Apparently organizations are increasing their commitment to GDSS and current implementations are heaviest in the remote/ local computer conferencing arena, especially in electronic mail. A factor analysis of respondent data showed that GDSS usually involves planning, administrative, and data analysis tasks. Usage also varies significantly with certain organizational size variables.",[],Detmar W. Straub,N/A,"Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA"

Need for “flexibility” in a conceptual model","Volume 18, Issue 5", Issue 5,"The translation of one data model into another has become necessary. Database design methodologies stipulate that a conceptual model should be created prior to implementing a new database system. It is then, usually, the translation of this conceptual model into the physical model of a commercial database management system (DBMS) that is a necessity (e.g., The translation of the entity-relationship model into a relational DBMS). However, more and more we are seeing the translation of the data models in currently implemented conventional file and database systems into conceptual models (e.g., The translation of an ORACLE DBMS into an entity-relationship model). It is the conceptual model that is produced from the ‘reverse’ translation process that we address here; however, the ideas of flexibility can be applied to new database designs also. Since several different reverse translation algorithms have been developed, the questions that arise are: How do we know the resulting conceptual models are accurate? Does the resulting model contain enough information to be useful to database designers and which one is easier for the database designer to work with and to use as a communication tool with users or to develop new databases? The problem is that resulting conceptual data models from two different algorithms may differ even in the data objects obtained, and yet both be equivalent to the original model.",[],Kathi Hogshead Davis,N/A,"Northern Illinois University, Department of Computer Science, Dekalb, IL 60115, USA"

Choosing a software cost estimation model for your organization: A case study","Volume 18, Issue 5", Issue 5,"In the last decade or so, many software cost estimation models have been developed. These differ substantially from each other, particularly with respect to the inputs required and their outputs. For a software manager, the problem of selecting a particular model, or a combination of models that can be applied to an individual organization, is not all trivial. This paper describes our efforts to solve this problem for two organizations who had collected data on past development efforts. Statistical correlations between the actual and the estimated efforts calculated by using different cost estimation models were obtained. Regression analysis revealed that the cost model that is used by the organizations is not ideal for their environment. Statistical tests show that the results obtained are indeed statistically significant. The methodology used to perform the case study is applied to predict the development effort for a project, and the result is quite impressive.",[],Jainendra K.

A model-based decision support system for locating banks","Volume 17, Issue 4", Issue 4,"The proper location of branch-banks is critical to the success of the banking business. The major ingredients for deciding where to locate branch-banks are: growth rates of deposits and loans; degree of competition; easy accessibility, and operating costs of potential sites. These are often highly sensitive to socio-economic, demographic, and behavioral factors that are ill-defined and fuzzy in nature. Accordingly, the traditional normative approach alone cannot analyze the excessive location-related data associated with the external factors and cannot appropriately evaluate behavioral criteria for branch-bank sites. In order to overcome these difficulties, this paper develops an interactive fuzzy goal programming model embedded within a locational decision support system for branch-banks. To demonstrate the practicality of the proposed model-based DSS, it has been applied to establish real-world-like location scenarios for commercial branch-banks in Columbus, Ohio.",[],Hokey Min,N/A,"College of Business Administration, University of New Orleans, New Orleans, LA 70148, USA"

It proposes nine guidelines to which an evaluation method should adhere. Three general methods for evaluation are then discussed: control group experiments, attitude scales, and multiple-criteria models. Each is reviewed in the light of the conceptual requirements for evaluation, as represented by the nine guidelines. A general multiple-criteria method that fits the nine guidelines is then presented.",[],Robert M.

A model for designing distributed database systems","Volume 17, Issue 3", Issue 3,"In designing distributed database systems, an important issue is the location of various copies of each database. This is known as the File Allocation Problem (FAP). This paper examines the impact of incorporating a specific concurrency control mechanism (CCM) into the FAP. Several mechanisms can be used, and, depending on the choice, the communication flows in the network will vary. In order to allocate data optimally, one must identify the exact communication flows. It is this that has been ignored in past research. Here a non-linear integer programming model has been formulated for the FAP. It incorporates the Central Node Locking mechanism for concurrency control. The model has been solved using an algorithm called ZOOM/XMP. Detailed analysis has been carried out for various configurations. Assumed values have been used for the various non-decision parameters that need to be entered.",[],Sudha Ram,N/A,"Department of Management Information Systems, Karl Eller Graduate School of Management, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA"

Methodology for end user computing in development administration","Volume 17, Issue 2", Issue 2,"Initiating the process for the successful introduction of microcomputers in developing countries requires a methodology, both at the conceptual and practical level, for integrating information technology into administrative functions.

The criteria for priority setting has been identified; this looks at the role of the key actors and goes beyond a need to merely spread awareness of the potential benefits or look at the technology itself. The paper concludes that strategic use of end user computing requires a conceptual analysis of the decisions that must be taken at various levels in development administration, developing a process of planning to match this with the information technology strategy and setting up support services to build up a knowledgeable end user to design and implement the necessary organizational changes.

The evolution of information resource management","Volume 16, Issue 5", Issue 5,"From the beginning of its use, the term information resource management (IRM) has had a wide range of meanings. This is due, in part, to its independent development in three different sectors of the information processing community: database management, records management and data processing management. This paper traces the origins and evolution of the concept of information resource management through a review of the IRM literature over the past fifteen years. The methodology involved examining definitions of IRM along the following dimensions: disciplinary perspective, management scope, societal sector, vocabulary and goals. It was found that while the IRM concept evolved in three different arenas with little interaction occuring among them, the current view of IRM represents a convergence of perspectives. IRM, today, has three goals: to maintain a global view of corporate data, to position the chief information officer at a high level in the corporate hierarchy, and to integrate both information and the information technologies. The future success of IRM will depend upon its ability to incorporate end users into the information management framework.",[],Eileen M.

Successful application of communication techniques to improve the systems development process☆","Volume 16, Issue 5", Issue 5,"Inadequate system requirements specifications reflect ineffective communication transactions between system users and developers. Today, effective communication between developers and users is more important than ever as organizations redirect resources to the development of decision/expert and communication support systems and to helping users develop their own systems. This paper reports on an exploratory study which tested the use of the Precision Model, a generalized communication model that draws upon a set of communication behaviors to facilitate effective communication between users and developers. These behaviors were incorporated into a general format for running design team meetings. The findings indicate that the new meeting format improved the communication between users and developers and enhanced their ability to develop shared, accurate and complete system requirements. In addition, the use of this format led to a reduction in the number of and length of meetings. It also demonstrated that developers were better able to develop and maintain rapport with users and that team members felt more productive and satisfied when meetings concluded. This research identifies specific behaviors and guidelines that can be used to improve the requirements definition process in any systems development project.",[],Robert P.

One of the most promising areas is that of Integrated Project Support Environments (IPSE's), which attempt to spread the focus of attention during software development from the coding stage to embrace the whole development cycle, from initial requirements specification to operational maintenance. These environments hope to improve production efficiency and quality by providing a complete set of support tools to help with each stage of software development, and to supply the necessary tool integration to ensure a smooth transition between these tools.

Information Resource Management: Is it sensible and can it work?","Volume 15, Issue 1", Issue 1,"Information Resource Management, or IRM, is founded on the assumptions that organizations are systems amenable to systematic control, and that information is a resource that can be managed in economically efficient ways. The management techniques embodied under the IRM rubric are said to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of information management in organizations. These assumptions are questioned. Systems approaches to organizations have proven inadequate in most instances where they have been tried, and there is little reason to believe the IRM approach will be different. Information is not a resource in the conventional sense of the term, and economic techniques for dealing with information as a resource are lacking. Implementation of IRM suffers from ambiguities about what it is supposed to accomplish, the breadth of its intentions, and the practical constraints of implementing top-down reforms in complex organizations.

Is today's office receiving full value from its computers?","Volume 15, Issue 1", Issue 1,"The office of today makes intensive and extensive use of electronic computers and data processing systems which provide powerful support for a host of realtime and transaction oriented applications essential to the offices' smooth operations. These systems do the work of uncountable “virtual clerks” who are managed by the real, human office and knowledge workers. A cursory examination shows that, in general, offices are doing their job rather well, the work is getting done. Nevertheless, the office of today is still using ADP largely as a tool — ADP is not the office. Not enough attention has been paid to the office's real structure, a complex system of procedural processes. Upon closer examination, many office “horror stories” and “computer goofs” turn out to be flawed or incorrectly executed procedures. Tutorial case examples cited include salary and grade review, realtime program testing, computer security, and bank check clearing operations. A fifth case, an accounts payable system, illustrates the benefits that proper system design and implementation can provide. Office procedures, therefore, are an urgent target for providing computer assistance.

This, combined with the widespread use of such MISs makes it of interest to further investigate them in manufacturing context. This paper provides an exploratory empirical examination of variance tracking MIS deficiencies. Via a simulation experiment, we find that, in an interdependent manufacturing context, variance-tracking MISs may severely misrepresent whether production departments are in or out of control. We thus agree with those who suggest that variance-tracking MISs may not be appropriate in interdependent manufacturing contexts.

This, combined with the widespread use of such MISs makes it of interest to further investigate them in manufacturing context. This paper provides an exploratory empirical examination of variance tracking MIS deficiencies. Via a simulation experiment, we find that, in an interdependent manufacturing context, variance-tracking MISs may severely misrepresent whether production departments are in or out of control. We thus agree with those who suggest that variance-tracking MISs may not be appropriate in interdependent manufacturing contexts. Contributions include an empirical demonstration of the kind and extent of MIS deficiencies that can occur in these contexts. However, the exploratory nature of this study imposes significant problems of external validity.",[],James T.

Though field interviews with MIS directors, it was possible to identify three widely held assumptions concerning the organizational level factors which might facilitate middle management participation from user organizations in systems design. To explore the relationship between these factors and user middle management participation, 152 user managers (functional area department heads) were studied from 55 firms. The results suggest that many firms may, unknowingly, manage their information system function in a manner which does not encourage user middle management involvement in the design of the systems they use.",[],William J.

Information systems planning: Lessons from strategic planning","Volume 12, Issue 5", Issue 5,"IS planning has changed considerably since its inception as an operational planning tool, expanding its scope to address key business objectives and forging a link with strategic business planning. A great deal of attention is currently focused on identifying and developing strategic information systems. Strategic planning has also become more broadly-focused over time, as simple forecasting techniques have been replaced by a variety of adaptive approaches that emphasize industry structure analysis and environmental dynamics. However, strategic planning has come under fire recently for failing to live up to its promises. As these two disciplines become more closely aligned, IS planners can learn from the experiences of strategic planners and, hopefully, avoid a similar crisis of confidence.",[],Ellen M.

Validating and applying user satisfaction as a measure of MIS success in small organizations☆","Volume 12, Issue 4", Issue 4,"Measurement of user satisfaction is a methodological problem crucial to information systems research. As the impact of an MIS upon organizational effectiveness is basically unmeasurable, measures of user satisfaction provide the most useful assessments of system success. This paper investigates the measurement of user satisfaction in the specific context of small organizations. An analysis of the potential impact of this specificity upon user satisfaction served as a basis for the selection and adaptation of a previously validated instrument.

We argue that it would be more fruitful to think in terms of managing information technology, in view of its perceived increasing strategic interest to organizations. The subject is treated from both an historical and organizational perspective.",[],Arnoud W. Zijlker,N/A,"Adviesbureau Zijlker BV, Villapark 9, 7491 BT Delden, The Netherlands"

Every manager is an information systems manager now, or, managing user-controlled information systems","Volume 11, Issue 5", Issue 5,"There are many examples of microcomputer based information systems built and operated by people in the departments using the systems - people who are not information systems professionals. When such “user-controlled systems” are used for departmental (as distinguished from individual) purposes, they are in effect miniature Information Systems Departments (ISDs), with all of the managerial and technical problems of such departments. The manager of the user department is, willy-nilly, an information systems manager, with all of the problems of the manager of the main ISD, and with little or no technical support staff. These problems require solutions in the microcomputer environment which are often different from the standard mainframe solutions, and in many cases the ISD staff has not developed appropriate microcomputer solutions. This paper reviews the relevant literature, most of which takes the Information Services Department point of view, gives examples of microcomputer-specific solutions to common information systems problems, and suggests ways in which the ISD can provide better support to managers of user-controlled departmental information systems.",[],Gerald M.

The purpose of the research was to establish whether a new generation of modelling technologies and concepts, as expressed by the notion of decision support systems, had been successful in resolving the problems experienced with previous generations of computer models. The research was based on a structured questionnaire completed by 51 selected users of packaged financial modelling systems. The results indicate that many problems have indeed been resolved by the new technology which emphasises the direct involvement in modelling activity of management responsible for the strategic management function and points to the key role of the “implementer” who provides the necessary interface.

The use of financial modelling in strategic planning","Volume 11, Issue 1", Issue 1,"The focus of this study is the application of computerised financial modelling technology to the strategic planning function of certain industrial and commercial organisations. The purpose of the research was to establish whether a new generation of modelling technologies and concepts, as expressed by the notion of decision support systems, had been successful in resolving the problems experienced with previous generations of computer models. The research was based on a structured questionnaire completed by 51 selected users of packaged financial modelling systems. The results indicate that many problems have indeed been resolved by the new technology which emphasises the direct involvement in modelling activity of management responsible for the strategic management function and points to the key role of the “implementer” who provides the necessary interface.

Do computer systems really pay-off?","Volume 11, Issue 1", Issue 1,"Over recent years IBM-UK has worked with a number of other organisations to appraise the financial returns achieved from computer systems. Using a standard methodology called SESAME, approximately 170 applications across a range of industries have been reviewed to date. This consistent base of information allows senior executives to compare the financial performance of computer systems with other investments; to set reasonable financial targets for new systems development; and to judge the ‘return on investment’ from their computer systems with that achieved by other companies. This paper provides an overview of the SESAME methodology, discusses some results of individual studies and summarises the general conclusions emerging from this work.",[],T.

On program development effort and productivity","Volume 10, Issue 5", Issue 5,"Many claims are made in the literature concerning large productivity increases as a result of the introduction of various new programming tools and techniques. Seldom do the researchers substantiate these claims, however. Further, many of the reported studies have been unsuccessful because much of the existing research is methodologically flawed and poorly grounded in theory. This paper investigates the methodological problems of previous studies and reports the results of a field study conducted to assess the feasibility of conducting controlled studies of the programming process. A field study of COBOL programs from three commercial organizations investigated the effects of programming style (i.e., structured programming) and programmer skill on (i) the effort required to develop programs and (ii) programming productivity; program size was used as a control variable. The results of the study support the underlying concept: that use of disciplined approaches and well-defined variables leads to more readily interpretable and more conclusive results.",[],Iris Vessey,N/A,"University of Pittsburgh, Graduate School of Business, Mervis Hall, Pittsburg, PA 15260, USA"

Distributed computer system design: An interactive procedure","Volume 9, Issue 5", Issue 5,"This paper presents an overview of an interactive system for the design of a distributed computer system. The system helps the designer in finding the optimal combination of processors of varying power to be located at various nodes of the system. It also helps in finding the optimal allocation of data files or databases. The system allows the designer to trade-off between the conflicting objectives: low investment and operating cost and high availability of data. Reasonable relative weights are assigned to each data file, and design objectives can be assigned priorities. A value added network such as TELENET is assumed for data communication. Also, multiple copies of the data file or database may exist in the system to achieve higher data availability and better response time.",[],Hemant K.

Attitudes toward telecommuting: Implications for work-at-home programs","Volume 7, Issue 3", Issue 3,"Telecommuting, or working at home through use of telecommunications systems, is receiving increasing attention in the popular literature. MIS managers interested in improving the productivity and job satisfaction of their technical personnel are beginning to consider work alternatives made possible by declining costs of data communications and the influx of microcomputers into homes and offices. Though interest is high, there is little material available which can serve to guide organizations when implementing remote work programs. The research discussed here examines the attitudes of 51 managers and 129 programmers toward working at home. Survey data were collected from 3 divisions in 2 locations of a computer services firm which had experimented with work at home. Results suggest more interest in telecommuting among programmers than project managers; surprisingly, the two groups tend to identify the same benefits and problems. In general, programmers express support for any alternative which would add variability and autonomy to their work, whether it is a change in work location or simply a change in scheduling.

Project management: Have we applied all that we know?","Volume 7, Issue 1", Issue 1,"Information systems projects are often successfully justified but fail in their development. This is usually caused by ineffective management of the project during development combined with an overemphasis on coding techniques. A proven management methodology effectively applied to every project addresses the unpredictability of new objectives, personnel re-organizations, and changing priorities. Key management components include: obtaining management commitment, planning the work, organizing the staff, setting project standards, guiding the team, communicating with general management, documenting decisions, motivating staff, negotiating changes, and training the user. Thorough application of these principles during each project, combined with tracking the actual performance versus the schedule, provides a quality data base of estimating criteria for a data processing organization.

The incremental benefits of changes in the timeliness of information","Volume 6, Issue 6", Issue 6,"The managers of all purposeful organizations rely on historical information as an aid to decision making. Information enables managers to formulate expectations about the future. Less timely information is generally inferior because the manager's expectations will contain greater error; and the operating results obtained may therefore be less satisfactory. The timeliness of information often can be improved by incurring incremental systems costs. However, the degree to which such improvements will produce benefits is uncertain. This research uses modeling to explore the relationship between information timeliness and the benefits derived by implementing optimal decisions based upon the information. The most significant finding is that the shape of this relationship is dependent upon the scope of the action set available to the decision maker. If a continuous range of options is available (such as a pricing decision), then the relationship is linear. If only a few discrete options are present (as in linear programming) the relationship is more complex but describable.

Methods of system development in Finland☆","Volume 6, Issue 2", Issue 2,"Interest in the use of different methodologies, methods and tools for information systems analysis and design has been increasing for the last decade in Finland. This has resulted in the founding of a special interest group in systems analysis and design within the Finnish Data Procesing Association and in its making a survey of the methods and tools in use in Finland in 1980. This survey was in the form of a questionnaire mailed to the company members of the association. The results of the survey show a wide use of different tools in the design and implementation of information systems. In the analysis phase, there seems to be a need for more and better methods and tools.

A management framework for systems users","Volume 5, Issue 6", Issue 6,"Many business managers today are in need of practical guidance in determining which information systems management practices are appropriate for their particular organization. Of central importance is the management of the information systems development process. A field research study was conducted at five major U.S. corporations to determine those information systems development management practices that had proved successful. The research method consisted of in-depth interviews with managers and technical people at each company. In addition, the reputation of each company as a successful manager of the information systems function was validated using a set of organizational performance criteria developed by a panel of prominent information systems professionals. The results of the research are presented in the form of a planning and control framework of successful management practices. The framework describes and classifies those practices common to all companies and clearly differentiates those practices which varied significantly among the companies studied. The framework is designed to enable management to readily identify those information system development practices that have proved successful and to select from among them those most appropriate to the local situation.

Adapting to changing user requirements☆","Volume 5, Issue 2", Issue 2,"Systems which have the capability of adapting to changing user requirements must be founded on accurate and perceptive models of the organisation in which they have to function. Design methods based on active user participation and the use of experimental and prototyping methods help to ensure accurate models. But because systems are expected to survive even when circumstances change, the designers have to have a view of what the future world will look like. A technique which helps to provide such a view is called “future analysis”. However, even designs based on the best prediction technique cannot guarantee a fit between the currently designed system and future needs. Hence it is important to design systems with built-in flexibility. A number of methods have been developed which reduce the disruption caused by the amendment or even replacement of a system or system's component.",[],Frank Land,N/A,"London School of Economics, Houghton Street, London WC2A 2AE, UK"

This paper suggests and empirically evaluates such an introductory MIS course suitable for an Executive MBA program (EMBA). The analysis reported here should be helpful to any educator teaching or preparing to teach MIS to executives. The evaluation indicates that executives seek both a hands-on educational experience with selected MIS technologies as well as a conceptual framework for managing and using MIS. Although not all MIS topics are deemed relevant, executives develop a strong need to insure a proper organizational direction for MIS activities. They are most concerned with understanding and controlling the evolution and rapid changes of MIS and look for ways that MIS can help them cope with change. For this reason, a successful course pedagogy includes joint case analysis with functional or technique courses in the overall curriculum.",[],Jeffrey A.

User involvement in system design: An empirical test of alternative approaches","Volume 4, Issue 4", Issue 4,"User involvement in the development of information systems is often assumed to be key to successful implementation.

The coming EDP developments will be influenced by social constraints. It will be insufficient to let EDP develop autonomously and to try to minimize the negative side effects. One must anticipate forthcoming developments and try to device a framework in which these developments can be used without negative side effects for society and the individual. On the other hand, one has the challenging task to steer the EDP developments such that they will meet the needs of the individual and society, and will increase the feeling of well-being, the prosperity and the feeling of self fullfillment of the individuals in that society.

Transystem tracing arrays: A macroflow analysis technique","Volume 3, Issue 5", Issue 5,"The transystem tracing array (TTA) is the basic building block for a transystem flow analysis technique. It helps analyse and document the flow through a processing system.

It has provided a simple and clear method for obtaining a brief and unambiguous overview of the trace (flow) through an entire system. TTAs are very easy to understand; they help users and analysts avoid bogging down in numerous system details of secondary interest, while maintaining a system-wide scale of perspective. The TTA technique is well suited to both the computerized portion of information systems and to manual office tasks for forms processing.

Is there a best MIS department location?","Volume 2, Issue 4", Issue 4,"An important organizational structure issue involves the positioning of the MIS department. When computers were first introduced, the data processing function was often placed within an accounting department. During the second generation of computer technology, some organizations operated different computers at different divisions; this generally resulted in a decentralized organizational structure. The third generation of computer technology provided a seemingly unlimited storage capacity and remote terminal capability; there was then a resurgance of centralization of control. Frequently, the MIS department was given a higher- level, separate organizational location. Empirical data attests to the merits of such a positioning. Today, in the fourth generation of computing, there are several options - a central MIS, a distribution MIS, or a dispersed MIS.

The definition of utilization is further refined by segmenting utilization into two distinct subsystems, a Human Information Processing system and a Data Selection system. As an initial investigation of the utilization process, it was decided specifically to study the relationship of the Data Selection system to the Human Information Processing system. The primary aim of this investigation was to determine whether factors that are internal to a decision-maker may affect the data selection process. “Cognitive style” was chosen as representative of internal factors. Measures of data selection and cognitive style were created with particular emphasis placed on the development of an instrument to measure cognitive style.
