According to many experts, BPR implementation requires a top-down, directive leadership style. Yet, it also requires the management of motivated, skilled, independent-thinking people doing non-programmable tasks for which a non-directive leadership style is most suited. This creates an inherent conflict for BPR leaders on choosing the appropriate style. Applying the leadership effectiveness framework, this study conducted an in-depth empirical analyses of the relationship between IS leadership behavior and BPR outcomes for 30 BPR projects. We found that successful BPR leaders use leadership styles that fit the type of task that needs to be done and the needs of the people that will perform the tasks. Also, successful BPR leaders balance their efforts between meeting the needs of the people doing the work and the needs of the work.

Results suggest that the more-innovative middle managers are inclined to use data drawn from personal experience and insights rather than historical data and found IT generally important. Apparently, innovative middle managers use less complex programs, and when in-depth analyses are needed, their execution was generally delegated. The prime interpretation of the results is that innovative middle managers use IT as a vehicle for networking. They distribute more of their IT output to others.

Extending the technology acceptance model with task–technology fit constructs","Volume 36, Issue 1", Issue 1,"During the past decade, two significant models of information technology (IT) utilization behavior have emerged in the MIS literature. These two models, the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the task–technology fit model (TTF), provide a much needed theoretical basis for exploring the factors that explain software utilization and its link with user performance. These models offer different, though overlapping perspectives on utilization behavior. TAM focuses on attitudes toward using a particular IT which users develop based on perceived usefulness and ease of use of the IT. TTF focuses on the match between user task needs and the available functionality of the IT. While each of these models offers significant explanatory power, a model that integrates constructs from both may offer a significant improvement over either model alone. We discuss the theoretical foundation of both these models and present a theoretical rationale for an integrated model. The result is an extension of TAM to include TTF constructs.

The development and use of the NHSnet in the United Kingdom provides an opportunity to review these lessons in a different context of health-information exchange. Combined with the use of stakeholder analysis, these lessons can enhance our understanding of the context, the stakeholders involved and affected by the network, their interests and their perceptions of collaborative advantage. It, therefore, provides useful insights in the lessons that healthcare policy makers can apply in the development and use of a collaborative network.

System usage behavior as a proxy for user satisfaction: an empirical investigation","Volume 35, Issue 4", Issue 4,"Organizations are increasingly recognizing that user satisfaction with information systems is one of the most important determinants of the success of those systems. However, current satisfaction measures involve an intrusion into the users' worlds, and are frequently deemed to be too cumbersome to be justified financially and practically. This paper describes a methodology designed to solve this contemporary problem. Based on theory which suggests that behavioral observations can be used to measure satisfaction, system usage statistics from an information system were captured around the clock for 6 months to determine users' satisfaction with the system. A traditional satisfaction evaluation instrument, a validated survey, was applied in parallel, to verify that the analysis of the behavioral data yielded similar results. The final results were analyzed statistically to demonstrate that behavioral analysis is a viable alternative to the survey in satisfaction measurement.",[],Charles E.

However, for scales used in basic research, more than 40% of them had a reliability lower than the minimal acceptable level, at least 0.80. Scales using interviews for data collection; with more items, obtained from previous studies; and generated from both literature review and interview, were found to have higher reliability. Other research design characteristics, including sample size, type of subjects, scale type, scale format and number of scale points, were found to be insignificant in affecting reliability.

Self-directed teams in IS: correlates for improved systems development work outcomes","Volume 35, Issue 3", Issue 3,"Self-directed work teams (SDWTs) often result from reengineering and process innovation efforts as well as recent movements to `downsize', or `flatten' organizations. Information systems (IS) departments have not been insulated from these trends. In spite of the rising interest in these teams, little is known about them in knowledge work settings like IS. Past research in blue-collar contexts suggests that teams result in performance improvements, while anecdotal evidence in the IS industry suggests that such improvements may never materialize. This paper reports on research conducted on 231 IS professionals from 28 systems development SDWTs across 13 organizations. Results indicate that while the autonomy inherent in SDWTs may lead to increased levels of satisfaction, motivation, and performance, the level of cooperative learning that takes place on the teams may be more important to achieving improved work outcomes.

While the interorganizational systems (IOSs) that support electronic markets or customer/supplier relations have been discussed in the literature, those which support `symbiotic networks' – those which form horizontal alliances to allow collaboration on the collective production of goods or services – have received little attention. An examination of the systems development literature and the strategic alliance literature suggested a number of issues; these were examined in an exploratory case study. In developing and implementing a collaborative interorganizational system, the traditional combination of an executive sponsor and a project champion appears to be insufficient for providing the necessary leadership. In particular, while some of the management tasks seem to require a sponsor who is external to all the partners, others need the presence of an executive sponsor within each organization. Unfortunately, the establishment of such a team of sponsors is a difficult task.

Adoption and implementation of CASE tools in Taiwan","Volume 35, Issue 2", Issue 2,"The aim of the research discussed here was to understand computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tool usage in Taiwan. Through a literature review, we developed two questionnaires – one for general respondents, the other for teachers and CASE agents. After pre-testing, 786 questionnaires were mailed out and 226 effective responses were obtained after two follow-up letters. Factor analyses were used to condense factors from `severity of critical problems in system development', `severity of perceived problems in CASE usage', `attitude toward CASE' and `CASE implementation success determinants'. Several external variables were considered in exploring their possible influence as well as the attitude and organizational features of the organizations that successfully used CASE. Path analyses were used to test an attitude model of CASE adoption and implementation success determinants. The results show that `the perceived problems in CASE tools' had no statistically significant influence on `attitude toward CASE' and very little influence on `perceived CASE improvement for system development critical problems'. In addition, we found that `methodology use' (including the usage before CASE adoption and consistency with the methodology supported by CASE) was the only statistically significant CASE implementation success determinant. Using only a `methodology use' variable could provide a way to discriminate the successful adopter from relatively unsuccessful adopter with a 75% correct classification rate.",[],Prof.Heng-Li Yang,N/A,"Department of Management Information Systems, National Cheng-Chi University, 64, Sec. 2, Chihnan Road, Mucha Dist., 116TaipeiTaiwan"

The model developed in this study shows that small businesses, often operating as suppliers for larger companies, could benefit in many ways from EDI through more extensive business integration with their own and their partners' value chains or an expanded customer base. Our empirical findings indicate that usually small businesses have used EDI in a way that was originally established by their principal, but they have not used the additional opportunities.

Perceived task complexity as a criterion for information support","Volume 34, Issue 5", Issue 5,"Here, the conceptual model of perceived task complexity, which incorporates the user, task, and system into a comprehensive unit of analysis, is used to investigate how, when, and why computer-assisted instruction (CAI) systems provide effective support. The work is based on data provided by 156 experimental subjects; information system (IS) use was found to vary by user groups depending on task performance. In addition, the effects of task presentation on task behavior and performance were found to vary between groups, based on their performance. The findings imply that user, task, and system dynamically interact in providing effective IS support. A comprehensive model of perceived task complexity that includes a user's domain knowledge is developed. This should help in further investigating into how, when, and why IS are effective.",[],Terry A Byrd,N/A,"Department of Management, College of Business, Auburn UniversityAuburn, AL 36849USA"

Can communication medium limitations foster better group outcomes? An action research study","Volume 34, Issue 5", Issue 5,"Media richness theory has been an influential deterministic theory of communication media adoption and use since its development in the mid-1980s. However, there has been mounting evidence, particularly in the 1990s, that predictions based on the media richness theory do not always hold. For example, there has been evidence that a lean communication medium can be the choice of groups engaged in complex tasks, such as strategic decision making, even when richer media are available. The two main shortcomings of most studies aimed at testing the media richness theory have been: (a) an orientation toward controlled settings, which hampers the drawing of implications for the usually `non-controlled' situations found in organizations in general; and (b) a focus on media adoption patterns, which has led to lack of evidence regarding group task outcomes. Here, we go some way towards filling this research gap by providing evidence that non-controlled groups can voluntarily adopt a communication medium that they perceive as lean. Moreover, we show that, due to a perception of the limitations imposed by the medium, group members can adapt their behavior in order to overcome such limitations, producing outcomes whose quality is perceived as higher by them than in richer media. We studied five process improvement groups in a New Zealand university. The groups, which redesigned typical university processes, voluntarily conducted most of their interactions through an e-mail conferencing system developed by the author.",[],Ned Kock,N/A,"Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Temple University, 1805 N.

We found little differences between the groups regarding different categories of software. We also found high proportions of support for protection of source and object codes. Both groups prefer stronger protection for systems than application software. Attorneys, more than developers, favored greater protection for application software than for game software. We expected software developers to favor regulations that would force owners of systems software to offer their creation to any interested party for equal terms.

However, when the task uncertainty is low, the UP makes no impact on the relation between performance and information characteristics.

We identify the potential of neural networks in the application domain and compare it to `classical' applications, such as the recognition of hand-written characters. Typical neural network architectures for R&D management tend to be simple, having low complexity, and only a small number of training samples are generally available. As an example, we carry out experiments for a typical R&D management application where neural networks have to estimate the final cost of a new product under development. It turns out that neural networks based on the standard backpropagation learning algorithm perform reasonably well when the ratio between highest and lowest cost is small, even for relatively small training set sizes. Otherwise the learning algorithm tends to undervalue low cost levels, so that deviations between estimated cost and real cost are intolerably high. Future research will have to investigate a modification of the error definition of the backpropagation algorithm. Finally, a number of general statements are derived from our experience, and examples are provided where neural networks are appropriate or inappropriate in the domain of R&D management.",[],Jürgen Bode,N/A,"Wirtschaftswissenschaftliche Fakulät, University Leipzig, Marschnerstr. 31D-04109 LeipzigGermany"

Managers and professional employees who used a multimedia ESS identified fewer threats and opportunities than those who used a text-based system.

The underpinnings of the model are based on domestic and international literature; and it has undergone extensive refinement through statistical evaluation and validation. The model and its accompanying instrument can be used to identify specific strategic IT factors for a company and a contingency analysis can be conducted to determine the importance of various factors based on organizational characteristics.

Managing natural resources using GIS: Experiences in India","Volume 32, Issue 1", Issue 1,"GIS technology is considered an exciting tool in the context of governmental planning systems for natural resource management in developing countries. However, despite rhetoric to the contrary, its impact has been of little value to national processes of development. The Indian government seems to be in the process of making long-term commitments to using GIS for natural resource management. National initiatives are being conceptualised and implemented by different organisations. They involve huge outlays of resources and have the potential to initiate large scale changes in district administration. For these changes to be productive, it is important that these initiatives are carefully planned.

The model is sufficiently general to allow evaluation of the performance of information flow processes employing any combination of people and information technologies (IT). It is used to evaluate alternative designs for using IT to improve the quality of the information produced from IP while reducing the resources required for exception handling. In two simulation experiments using the model, advanced IT improved information quality significantly. They did not, however, always reduce flow time and human resource time.

Residual performance risk, defined as the extent of difficulty in estimating performance outcomes during the later stages of the project, was modeled as a mediating variable. Based on a prior theory, six hypotheses were derived and empirically tested using a survey design.

Electronic publishing: A product architecture perspective☆","Volume 31, Issue 2", Issue 2,"Information products, like physical ones, require well-designed platforms from which multiple versions of a product can be easily and efficiently derived. This study investigated the design implications of converting a large subscription-based industry-research firm to an electronic publishing and distribution process. The analysis applied concepts used in designing architectures for physical goods. Electronic publishing technology, in addition to providing a new automated production platform, enabled the firm to move from a traditional document-based publishing paradigm to one more akin to an information refinery based on the storage and integration of modular information-units. That move had a significant impact on how documents were written, edited, and marketed. It was found that digitizing documents alone is not sufficient to create a flexible enough electronic publishing platform from which multiple versions of a document-based information product may be derived. Rather, the entire structure of the document must be reconceived in terms of more primitive information-units that can be digitized, indexed, and linked for retrieval in a variety of ways.",[],Michael H.

Researchers and practitioners often rely on subjective assessment and surrogate measures, such as the user information satisfaction (UIS) instrument. The UIS instrument has been widely accepted even though criticized for neglecting the essential issues related to the success of IS. It measures success only indirectly, by assessing the quality of the IS product and related services. By extending the measure of success to also include the development process (standing for the investment costs and efficient use of the resources) and the impact of the IS on the organization (standing for the benefits of the investment), we allow for a more comprehensive and direct assessment of the IS development projects that better conforms to the idea of a traditional cost-benefit analysis, relevant to the managers responsible for the IS investments. Measurement scales for the resulting four dimensions of success—the development process, use process, IS product quality and impact of the IS on the organization—were developed and tested for reliability and validity, by studying the IS development projects in major Finnish companies.",[],Timo Saarinen,saarinen@hkkk.fi,"Helsinki School of Economics, Runeberginkatu 14-16, FIN-00100 Helsinki, Finland"

An empirical investigation on factors affecting the acceptance of CASE by systems developers","Volume 30, Issue 6", Issue 6,"This paper presents the findings of an empirical study of factors affecting the acceptance of CASE by systems developers. Based on two research models (technology acceptance and personal computer utilization) recently published in IS literature, an integrated model which consists of six variables and incorporates key elements of both models was developed to examine determinants of CASE acceptance. The findings indicate that ease of use has the largest influence on CASE acceptance, followed by long-term consequences. Both transitional support and near-term usefulness do not have a significant direct effect on the acceptance but exhibit their indirect influence through ease of use and/or long-term consequences. The implementation gap was found to have a relatively small and negative effect on CASE acceptance through its influence on ease of use, near-term usefulness, and long-term consequences. Implications of the findings, from both a research and a managerial perspective are discussed in this paper.",[],Patrick Y.K.

Due to the uncertain and changing nature of the processes, it is important for negotiators to have access to previous records, to communicate effectively with each other, and to have an agent acting as the mediator when deadlocks occur. This paper presents a computer model which employs case-based reasoning (CBR) to provide intelligent support to construction negotiations. This model has been implemented in the MEDIATOR, a computer program that utilises previous cases as a basis for addressing new problems. In contrast to conventional expert systems (ESs) that use compiled knowledge in problem solving, the system selects similar cases to help in solving a given negotiation problem. The selected case is then modified and adapted to generate proposals that should move people towards a settlement.",[],Heng Li,Heng.Li@eng.monash.edu.au,"Department of Civil Engineering, Caulfield School of Engineering, Monash University, Melbourne 3145, Vic., Australia"

IT divergence in reengineering support: Performance expectations vs. perceptions","Volume 30, Issue 5", Issue 5,"Current literature is replete with reports highlighting the successes and failures of business process reengineering (BPR) efforts. Organizations have begun to realize the key enabling role of information technology (IT) in support of these efforts. However, expectations of the influence of IT in BPR as well as aspects of the organization which influence IT, may far outweigh the actual results. A panel of experts was questioned and 43 businesses currently undergoing reengineering were examined in order to determine a ‘divergence’ between expectations and observations on the role of IT in BPR. The organizational groups within the businesses consisted of business managers, executives, administrative/staff personnel, IT personnel, and consultants actually involved in reengineering projects. The study sought answers to three research questions: Are there significant differences in IT in BPR expectations and observations?, Do they vary by constituency group?, and Do they vary according to the level of organizational IT effectiveness? The study identified three factors that represent significant differences in these shortfalls. These are labeled as Strategic Planning Empowerment, IT Support for Process Improvement, and IT/Business Politics.

Some empirical evidence on IS Strategy Alignment in banking","Volume 30, Issue 4", Issue 4,"Recent research amongst North-American and European IS managers shows that for both groups the alignment of IS strategy and corporate strategy is a top priority. IS alignment approaches do, however, exist, describing a generic process, independent of the characteristics of any particular industry or company. Here, an attempt is made to apply IS Strategy Alignment to banking, with the aim to identify major issues and to attempt to determine the relationships between these issues, based on a research project in a number of European banks. This work suggests that the main problem in generating improved IS Strategy Alignment is a lack of overall sector knowledge (not skills) amongst banking managers. Awareness of IS issues (even the softer ones) does not cause problems, but the application of these issues in the banking world does. The influence of mind sets on IS Strategy Alignment awareness proved to be important. Based on an experience with the analytical methods used and the results obtained, other methods of empirical investigation are suggested, including new issues in IS Strategy Alignment.",[],Walter R.J.

Life in the middle: An analysis of information centers from the perspective of their major stakeholders","Volume 30, Issue 3", Issue 3,"Information Centers (ICs), in their mission of supporting end-user computing, find themselves in the middle of two different constituencies, users and Information Systems (IS) managers. A conceptual model, based on role theory, is presented here to explore the special challenges of “life in the middle”, such as different expectations about the roles that should be performed by IC professionals, different criteria for evaluating their performance, and different perceptions of their success. These special challenges were empirically studied through in-depth interviews with users, IS Managers and IC Managers, in a random national sample of forty-seven Fortune 500 companies. The results indicate that, given the multiple expectations surrounding Information Centers, IC professionals need to be flexible in adopting different roles, skilled in coping with different sets of performance criteria, and keenly aware of the highly subjective nature of the evaluations received from their diverse constituents.",[],Regina F.

An objective, entropy-based approach to evaluating migration issues in computer IS","Volume 29, Issue 6", Issue 6,"Recent breakthroughs in computing technology have created a set of perplexing new problems for information systems (IS) professionals. These revolve around decisions to be made about replacing current systems with newer technology, upgrading existing systems, and migrating to other platforms or environments. Many decision makers must rely on subjective assessments, such as their instincts or the recommendation of vendors rather than on an objective analysis of their information needs and how they can be met by various system alternatives. A model to quantify these issues, providing an objective measure for comparing system alternatives, including migration, would be valuable. Such a model is demonstrated here; it uses the Shannon-Weaver entropy model in conjunction with quality measures to quantify actual and potential system effectiveness.",[],Roy Martin Richards Jr.,richardm@cobaf.unt.edu,"Department of Business Computer Information Systems, College of Business Administration, University of North Texas, Box 13677, Denton TX 76203-3677, USA"

We found that a high degree of technical orientation results in the perception that moving into management would bring better pay and advancement prospects; this then leads to job dissatisfaction.

A dialectic view of information systems outsourcing: Pros and cons","Volume 29, Issue 5", Issue 5,"In recent years, information systems (IS) outsourcing is increasing in business organizations as a way to govern their IS operations. Burgeoning IS costs, lack of IS organization's responsiveness to users, and a renewed emphasis on return on IS investment are among some of the reasons towards this trend. Media reports are almost unanimous, and at times euphoric, in their claims of benefits. However, a reporting bias must be recognized: first, these reports are, at best, anecdotal accounts and second, they are based on the accounts of outsourcing vendors, consultants, senior executives and those who remained or were promoted in the organization after the outsourcing act. Naturally, these individuals have a vested interest in making their decisions look beneficial. This article discusses the various advantages and pitfalls of IS outsourcing, based on a dialectic view. It provides a balanced perspective, as it is based on a real case discussed by two individuals who were on opposing sides of the fence: one was an outsourcing survivor and was promoted, and the other was terminated due to decisions related to outsourcing.",[],Prashant C.

Intelligent database design using the unifying semantic model","Volume 29, Issue 4", Issue 4,"Research and development in the field of database systems has culminated in its widespread use. As usage has grown, the desire to link separate databases has resulted in substantial effort being directed towards the design of distributed database systems. A major research issue in designing such systems is the definition of a formal model that can be used to capture the semantics of the individual databases. This paper presents a semantic model called the Unifying Semantic Model (USM) and a software tool using it. The USM can be used for modeling the complex interrelationships and semantics found in a manufacturing environment. It is based on enhancements to existing semantic models. It can serve as a formal specification and documentation tool for databases. It can provide a means of specifying the Universe of Discourse for any interchange of information.",[],Sudha Ram,N/A,"Department of Management Information Systems, Eller School of Management, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA"

The reality is that the EIS of today is moving down the organisational structure and the executive is still waiting for the benefits of information technology.

It first describes the nexus between computing, executive management style and information systems. Then it discusses action research, as carried out on two small Australian companies. In using this methodology particular attention was paid to addressing any inherent weaknesses. The outcomes provided one executive with information tools that allowed for an extension of his creative work processes and the other with rapid internal monitoring of crucial production data. In the former case, all aspects of the methodology were successful, however the latter was flawed due to external commercial forces.",[],Andrew Stein,N/A,"Department of Business Computing, Faculty of Business, Victoria University of Technology, P.O. 14498 MMC, Melbourne, 3000, Australia"

Pre-physical data base design heuristics","Volume 28, Issue 6", Issue 6,"Data base design encompasses both business and technical aspects. Conceptual data modelling creates a conceptual schema to abstract the user view of data within the business context. This conceptual schema is mapped to the logical data model structure in order to obtain a set of normalized relations. These ensure the integrity of the data by avoiding update anomalies. Regardless of the methodology used, the process or transaction model will impact on the data base design process and its refinement. Since the process or transaction model will reflect the business requirements and specific users view of the data, it will determine the relevance of having a fully normalized set of data, or the need for trading off some degree of normalization, with the aim of improving performance in the query process. The model will also indicate the activity requirements on the relations in the logical data model, their frequency, and characteristics. A pre-physical design step is described, and a set of heuristics is proposed in order to obtain a refined data base design.",[],Narciso Cerpa,narciso@cse.unsw.edu.au,"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney 2052, NSW, Australia"

This study provides empirical support for the proposition that user development allows end-user departments to minimize the agency costs resulting from the work of the MIS department.

Comparison of object-oriented and traditional systems development issues in distributed environments","Volume 28, Issue 5", Issue 5,"The client/server model for application development is becoming popular with Australian organisations. While the literature suggests that issues such as task partitioning and task allocation are important in distributed application design, no prior research has been reported on the relative importance of these issues and the adequacy with which current traditional and object-oriented methodologies support distributed application design. The reported research involved a multiple case study of Australian organisations undertaking client/server development. While the same issues appear to be important for both OO and non-OO client/server development, the developers of the OO projects placed greater emphasis on task partitioning, intermodule communications, interprocess communications, and application topology. Current methodologies were found to provide little or no support for these important issues in client/server development. In fact there was no significant difference in the support offered by all methodologies.",[],David Han,N/A,"Bankers Trust, Sydney, NSW Australia"

Commercializing public information: A critical issue for governmental IS professionals","Volume 28, Issue 4", Issue 4,"Public data is viewed as an increasingly valuable commodity by business. Access to this data is affected by many federal and state legislative acts, most notably the Freedom of Information, Privacy Act, and Open Access laws. Some governmental agencies recognize that their data is a saleable commodity and are seeking to charge access fees that exceed actual copying costs. It is important for public information systems managers to recognize their role in dealing with the most salient issues arising from the commercialization of public data, including their ability to charge fees for their data that are in excess of copying costs to recover reasonable costs related to obtaining and formatting the information and the degree to which they must respond to specialized formatting and access requests.",[],Fritz H.

Minimizing maintenance anomalies in expert systems","Volume 28, Issue 3", Issue 3,"Expert systems are emerging as a powerful technology for solving many problems previously requiring human experts. However, maintenance has been identified as a major difficulty in expert system implementations. Surprisingly, the problem of maintenance has only recently begun to receive attention in expert systems research, though it has long been an issue in databases. Databases are in a constant state of change, and the prevention of maintenance anomalies is essential. As similar maintenance operations are performed on rule bases, this paper investigates techniques to avoid maintenance anomalies in expert system rule bases. The result is an expert system rule base structure that is appropriate for volatile production use. In addition to lower maintenance demands, this approach favorably impacts on verification, computational efficiency, and storage requirements.",[],R.C.
