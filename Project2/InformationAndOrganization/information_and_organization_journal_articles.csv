Risk and the future of AI: Algorithmic bias, data colonialism, and marginalization","Volume 33, Issue 3", September 2023,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), and discussions surrounding its potential uses, have escalated into polarised debates about the future, capturing a wide range of utopian and dystopian imaginations (Bove, 2023; Bucknall & Dori-Hacohen, 2022). In this editorial, we focus on the duality of risk around potential benefit and potential harm (Roff, 2019) associated with the future of AI. This is of critical importance in developing our understanding of AI as an emerging technology; one whose uses and effects are still uncertain and have yet to stabilize around a recognizable set of patterns (Bailey, Faraj, Hinds, Leonardi, & von Krogh, 2022). A particular focus is on algorithmic bias which is a direct function of the quality of the data that the AI algorithms are trained on, and that are effective only for those populations where there is access to training data. As we discuss further below, algorithmic bias has important implications for reshaping diversity, inclusion and marginalization. Additionally, we highlight the potential harm experienced by those largely invisible workers in the Global South who clean up data and refine algorithm development for the benefit of those using algorithms in the Global North. This emerging trend of data colonialism (Couldry & Mejias, 2019) is of critical importance given the fundamental reliance of AI technologies on data, and because organizations gain access to, control data, and develop algorithms in ways which not only emphasize the digital divide but increase data inequality (Zheng & Walsham, 2021).

Risk and the future of AI: Algorithmic bias, data colonialism, and marginalization","Volume 33, Issue 3", September 2023,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), and discussions surrounding its potential uses, have escalated into polarised debates about the future, capturing a wide range of utopian and dystopian imaginations (Bove, 2023; Bucknall & Dori-Hacohen, 2022). In this editorial, we focus on the duality of risk around potential benefit and potential harm (Roff, 2019) associated with the future of AI. This is of critical importance in developing our understanding of AI as an emerging technology; one whose uses and effects are still uncertain and have yet to stabilize around a recognizable set of patterns (Bailey, Faraj, Hinds, Leonardi, & von Krogh, 2022). A particular focus is on algorithmic bias which is a direct function of the quality of the data that the AI algorithms are trained on, and that are effective only for those populations where there is access to training data. As we discuss further below, algorithmic bias has important implications for reshaping diversity, inclusion and marginalization. Additionally, we highlight the potential harm experienced by those largely invisible workers in the Global South who clean up data and refine algorithm development for the benefit of those using algorithms in the Global North. This emerging trend of data colonialism (Couldry & Mejias, 2019) is of critical importance given the fundamental reliance of AI technologies on data, and because organizations gain access to, control data, and develop algorithms in ways which not only emphasize the digital divide but increase data inequality (Zheng & Walsham, 2021). Based on these reflections, we propose a relational risk perspective as a useful lens in studying the dark side of AI around algorithmic bias, data colonialism, and increasing marginalization which is largely under-represented in the literature.",[],E.

Because OSI brings multiple stakeholders together, and each stakeholder participates voluntarily, data governance in OSI has a distributed nature. In this essay we put forward a framework consisting of three dimensions allowing an inquiry into the effectiveness of such distributed data governance: (1) openness (i.e., freely sharing data and information), (2) accountability (i.e., willingness to be held responsible and provide justifications for one's conduct) and (3) power (i.e., resourceful actors' ability to impact other stakeholder's actions).

The pandemic acts as a natural breaching experiment that foregrounds often backgrounded issues with digitalization.

Issues include uneven access, the persistence of the analog, the brittleness of digitalization, and panoptical surveillance.

As digital innovation research we are too often: a) reifying the agency of digital innovation actors; b) developing explanations of digital innovation detached from the specifics of digital technology, and c) developing overly specific explanations of digital innovation. I begin by providing a brief overview of the recombination perspective and considering why this perspective holds great appeal in the digital age. I then engage with Henfridsson et al.'s (2018) value spaces framework as a platform for framing value creation and value capture in relation to recombination in digital innovation. Next, I push Henfridsson et al.'s arguments one step further to discuss them in relation to what I consider to be the key challenges for digital innovation research. Illustrating with some of my own recent projects, I suggest that in order to fully address these challenges we need to (1) develop explanations of digital innovation acknowledging the complexity of sociomaterial interaction in digital innovation; (2) develop explanations of digital innovation building on the specifics of digital technology, and (3) develop explanations of digital innovation based on an oscillation between the specific and the general.

However, different conceptions of information often make incommensurable assumptions about what information is. This essay introduces a ‘consequential framework’ revealing different assumptions made about the nature of information and the consequences following from these assumptions. According to this consequential framework four stances on the existence of information can be distinguished: (1) A first stance assumes information to exist independently of humans as part of the physical world, for instance, in the structure of the universe or the transmission of signals; (2) a second stance assumes that information exists in signs but in a observer independent way, such as in objective facts about things; (3) a third stance assumes that information exists only in relation to a subject, so that the same document, report or data will convey different information to different individuals; (4) a fourth stance assumes information to exist within a sociocultural setting, as lawyers, doctors or accountants differ in what is information to them. Each of these four stances makes vastly different assumptions about how information can be accessed and used by humans.

Social media are ushering in an era of leaky knowledge,
•
Enabling knowledge to leak out from the pipes through which it travels to distant corners of the organization - and to vistas beyond the organization – presents a whole new set of opportunities and challenges for the management of organizational knowledge.
•
Yet for such a revolution to occur, individuals need to willingly contribute knowledge by communicating with others through social media and following the communications of others so that they can retrieve knowledge.

Although the motivation of contribution and retrieval is a perennial obstacle for knowledge sharing, the affordances of the social media that are just now entering many workplaces may provide unique and improved abilities at overcoming these obstacles.",[],Paul M.

The paper is distinctive in eschewing post-structuralist uses of Saussurian semiotics, and recent theorizations of sociomateriality, instead developing an integrative framework grounded in Habermasian concepts, Peirceian semiotics and an underlying, integrating critical realist philosophy. We develop a semiotic framework to help analyze the complex interactions between three different worlds – the personal, the social and the material. Here semiosis relates to the personal world through the generation and interpretation of signs and messages. It relates to the material world in that all signs must have some form of physical embodiment in order to be signs, and must also be transmitted through some form of physical media. Semiosis relates to the social world in that the connotive aspects of sign systems are social rather than individual – they exist before and beyond the individual's use of signs. The personal, social and material worlds between them bear relationships of sociation, sociomateriality and embodiment.

This paper presents the story of scaling of an artifact (called District Health Information Software — DHIS) and associated principles and practices around a health information system that has taken place over 15 years, both within and between multiple developing countries. Through the lens of the story of the artifact over its trajectory of development and implementation in multiple contexts and time, we develop insights that challenge traditional thinking around scaling. Scaling is not about constant gains and expansion, as is often assumed, but involves a dichotomy of losses and gains, associated with each step or translation in its process of movement. We draw upon Latour's insights on circulating references to analyze this dichotomy of loss and gains, conceptualizing the process as circulating translations. We contribute to the technology transfer literature in arguing that the process of transfer is not about a “parachuting” from point A to B, or a “design from nowhere” but something which occurs in a series of small steps, where with each step new socio-technical configurations are created which not only shape subsequent steps, but also redefine the content of the artifact. In this way, we are in line with findings from the social studies of technology, but differ in that our artifact of study – software – is more “virtually immaterial” than machines which had been primarily earlier objects of study. This property of software, coupled with growth of web-based and mobile infrastructure, allows relative ease of circulation across contexts, where it gets redefined and embedded at the same time at the interconnected levels of the global and local. We conceptualize this process of global scaling as being “same, same, but different”. We discuss both the characteristics of this process of global scaling, and the channels and mechanisms through which it takes place. Four overlapping conditions that shape this process include the software itself, the infrastructure, institutional practices, and ideas — these form the basis for a general framework to understand global scaling of health information systems. Empirically, the story of DHIS is told from its birth in the mid-nineties in South Africa developed on a Microsoft platform to its transformation to a web-based platform, built using Java based open-source frameworks, and now moving through multiple countries.

It begins by providing a brief overview of the sociomaterial perspective on organizational practices and considers why this perspective holds great appeal at this point in time. I then engage with Mutch's (2013) critique of the agential realist foundation upon which most current discussions of sociomateriality are constructed to highlight what practical problems are generated when authors attempt to map agential realism's philosophical discussion onto empirical phenomena. Next, I attempt to make explicit what Mutch leaves implicit in his paper: how building studies of sociomateriality on the theoretical foundation offered by critical realism can, potentially, overcome some of the practical problems created by a footing on agential realism. Finally, I push Mutch's arguments one step further to compare what practical consequences arise when researchers attempt to construct studies of sociomateriality on either of these two theoretical foundations. I suggest that there are important implications for what one can study, how one can study it, and how scholars can contribute to theory on technology and organizing based on the theoretical foundation they choose to build upon.",[],Paul M.

Two findings are that the intercommunal negotiation was established not just between individual networks of practice in the project, but with reference to an emerging community of practice that served as a boundary object, and that intercommunal negotiation also had to be carried out diachronically across time, with this latter form of negotiation being difficult to achieve.",[],Catherine Hall,ceh48@drexel.edu,"The iSchool at Drexel University, 3141 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA"

The analyses articulate the work done to maintain this digital infrastructure and also to move designs beyond the closed world of a computer to a physical reality. In changing medium, engineers use heterogeneous trials to interrogate and address the limitations of an integrated digital model. The paper explains why such trials, which involve the reconciliation of digital and physical data through parallel and iterative forms of work, provide a robust practice for realizing goals that have physical outcomes. It argues that this practice is temporally different from, and at times in conflict with, building a comprehensive dataset within the digital medium.

These non-cognitive ingredients are less amenable for study using the structurational model, but receive comprehensive treatment elsewhere in Giddens' work. Accordingly, it is argued that a useful direction for future theory development would be to seek a more balanced account of humans' co-constitutive relationship with technology in practice. This could be achieved by supplementing the structurational perspective, with its primary focus on emergent social structure, with a more explicit engagement with Giddens' broader concern with emergent biographical structure. An initial integrative framework is offered as a first step in this direction.",[],Mark Thompson,m.thompson@jbs.cam.ac.uk,"Judge Business School, Trumpington Street, Cambridge, CB2 1AG, United Kingdom"

Dual materiality highlights how digital technology becomes important, as its materiality plays an integral part in creating, not simply representing, the materiality of the physical world. We elaborate upon this insight through a theory on sociomaterial knowing grounded in ethnographic fieldwork within a petroleum company. The main theoretical proposition of this theory is that knowing arises from the emerging patterns of interaction between material phenomena, the material arrangements for knowing about these phenomena, and knowledge practices. We elaborate upon this through three predominant modes of knowing in petroleum production: instrumentation, interpretation, and learning.

We argue that context can be conceived of as a dynamic outcome constructed through processes of development and interpretation rather than as an entity which can be isolated and represented. Instead of focusing on the adequacy of the representation of context—the motivation of contextualism—researchers should consider the processes by which context is represented. Three principles are proposed to assist in this endeavour. Firstly, representation of context is a relational process in which both ‘macro’ and ‘micro’ actors engage. Understanding the context of ICT4D requires multiple accounts drawn from different actors. Secondly, while research needs to describe the concepts used by ‘macro’ actors to represent context, it is crucial to recognize them as outcomes of processes of development and not as self-evident entities. Finally, we suggest that research needs to attend to how these accounts are produced, be they by ‘macro’ and ‘micro’ actors. This can be understood as an emergent activity showing not only unexpected outcomes but also that the concepts describing actors change in development. These principles are applied to the case of M-PESA, now widely known as an innovative mobile banking application from Kenya.

This is evidenced by the growing trend in the number of studies that address cultural issues in IS literature over the last several decades. Regardless of the contribution of many research studies up to now, various challenges still need to be addressed: firstly, studies continue to view culture as well integrated and shared equally among organizational members; secondly, there is a tendency for studies to downplay the dynamics of culture and how this influences IS adoption over time; and thirdly, there is an increased need to analyze culture using in-depth interpretative and longitudinal methods. This paper proposes that our understanding of IS culture can be enhanced by combining theoretical approaches in which the weakness of one approach can be complemented by the strength of another. More specifically, by combining Martin's (2002) three perspectives on culture — integration, differentiation and fragmentation and grid and group cultural theory (for instance, Douglas, 1970; Thompson et al., 1990), can offer a more penetrating account of how organizational culture influences IS adoption. This argument is demonstrated using an in-depth interpretative (retrospective) case study of a further and higher education college in the UK and its unsuccessful attempt to adopt a virtual learning environment (VLE).",[],Stephen Jackson,stephen.jackson@beds.ac.uk,"University of Bedfordshire Business School, Vicarage Street, Bedfordshire, LU1 3JU, United Kingdom"

To understand this, a multi-method approach has been used to provide different lenses through which to observe the online practices of a specific group of practitioners. Analysis was performed using a modified version of Silverstone's (1992) domestication framework. It is proposed that users embed (internalise) online technologies within their ‘busy day’ — which often requires much effort and involves configuration and learning (learning by trying).

A review of the literature on user innovation is conducted, after which a refined conceptualization of this topic encompassing the Foucauldian and social shaping of technology traditions is offered. A discourse analytic approach is used to examine both the process and the outcome of user innovation. Through an interpretive case study, a set of discourses evolving within an OSS project's website is identified, each implying particular subject positions for the OSS users and OSS developers in software production and consumption processes. Particular kinds of subject positions for the OSS users are adopted, negotiated, opposed as well as created by the OSS users in the analyzed discourses. The developers are in an authoritative position as the decision-makers and the ones realizing the innovations, but the users are allowed important positions of co-creators and co-cultivators. User innovation is characterized as a continuous, evolving co-creation process of the modes of subjectivity offered for the OSS users. This kind of process could be experimented with in other kinds of development contexts. On the other hand, this study questions many assumptions related to user innovation that are taken for granted, highlighting the difficulty of simply and straightforwardly enhancing it in any context. Finally, implications for theory and practice are discussed.",[],Netta Iivari,Netta.Iivari@oulu.fi,"Department of Information Processing Science, University of Oulu, P.O.

Drawing on media theory, the article suggests that the materiality observed through the use of technology is not detached from these technologies but constitutes instances inextricably bound up with the particular technology. Following Barad (2003), matter is a practice, a set of doings accomplished through the mobilization of a heterogeneous body of resources. In the technosciences, species of nature (e.g. laboratory animals) are shaped to comply with operational hypotheses and underlying assumptions. Similarly, in financial trading, markets are constituted through the use of ensembles of technologies of vision. In this view, most vision is media-laden, intimately associated with the materialities organized to accomplish particular modes of seeing.

We say ‘implausible’ because from the point of view of micro-sociological analysis and the influential work of Orr (1996) there is a consensus that the diagnosis and resolution of technical failures is an intrinsically ‘localised affair’ (i.e., rooted within a specific place and time). Notwithstanding this view, technology producers have been pushing in the recent period to develop online forms of support. Today, and particularly in the area of organisational software, many technical failures are now repaired at a distance. How is this possible given the consensus amongst sociologists? Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted at a major software producer we show how repair work has been recast and inserted in a new geographical and temporal regime. This has implications for how sociologists of technology conceptualise the nature and practice of technical failure but also the time and situation in which it occurs. We attempt to refocus understandings of technical problems from a preoccupation with their rootedness onto how they are lifted out of local contexts and passed around globally distributed offices in search of requisite specialist expertise. Importantly, whilst virtualisation appears a seemingly effective means to resolve failures it also has negative consequences. Whereas in more traditional types of technical support place-based social relations are seen to bear the burden of controlling and regulating support, in online forms other means have to be found. Our conceptual aim is to move away from a view of repair revolving exclusively around the situation conceived of as a ‘small place’. Rather, since support work is increasingly ‘stretched out’ across a global network of labs connected up by technologies, it now takes place across an extended situation.

Notwithstanding this view, technology producers have been pushing in the recent period to develop online forms of support. Today, and particularly in the area of organisational software, many technical failures are now repaired at a distance. How is this possible given the consensus amongst sociologists? Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted at a major software producer we show how repair work has been recast and inserted in a new geographical and temporal regime.

(2004). Rum, tid och pengar – En studie om redovisning i praktiken. Doctoral Thesis, Göteborg: BAS]. It starts conceptually by seeing accounting and its references as a ‘chain of translations’ [Latour, B. (1998). Artefaktens återkomst. Stockholm: Knowledge and Society; Latour, B. (1999). Pandora’s hope. Essays on the reality of science studies. Cambridge: Harvard University Press]. Empirically it follows a puzzling set of such references, from a psoriasis clinic where accounting is unfamiliar – so part of what [Tuan, Y. -F. (2001). Space and place, 8th ed. London: University of Minnesota Press] would call a ‘space’ – to a central finance function where it is taken for granted embodied knowledge, and so part of ‘place’, and then back, to observe how these references become integrated into medical everyday work and its embodied ways of knowing, establishing the clinic as an accounting ‘place’ for those who work there.. It then argues that as these references become more taken for granted, accounting acts as a special Actor because of the way it circulates inside and outside both human and non-human ‘actants’, as a machine which always names and counts, so constituting space, time and valuing through its flexible ‘named numbers’.. It tracks how accounting moves to becoming familiar and expands its reach through four categories: ‘the character of the associations’, ‘the integration of associations and the delimitation of movement’, ‘order and its relation to change; and ‘the production of other spaces’. This illuminates how accounting draws actants into its chains or circuits of value, thus extending its ability to construct both facts and acts. Here the paper supplements the actor-network approach with ideas drawn from the work of Hoskin and colleagues [e.g. Ezzamel, M., & Hoskin, K. (2002). Retheorizing the relationship between accounting, writing and money with evidence from Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt. Critical Perspectives on Accounting, 13, 333–367; Hoskin, K. (1981).

Accounting and the examination: A genealogy of disciplinary power. Accounting, Organisation and Society, 11, 105–136] which see accounting as a visible sign system naming and counting from before the invention of writing, and so having a special priority in settings concerned with coordinating action in space and across time. In modern managerial worklife settings, its named numbers circulate as paper and electronic texts which are strategically central to both financial and non-financial coordination of resources and actants. This helps clarify why accounting should be such a special Actor, as well as how it functions as machine.",[],Ann-Christine Frandsen,Ann-Christine.Frandsen@wbs.ac.uk,"School of Business, Economics and Law, Göteborg University, SE 405 30, Gothenburg, Sweden"

In this new perspective, the concept of attention also became a source of interest for both researchers and management writers. Theories of perception and attention are closely associated with the use of media. While media have always been used in organizing, more recent digital media are producing new forms of communication and control in organization. Following [Beller, J. (2006). The cinematic mode of production: Attention economy and the society of the spectacle.

It seeks to shed new light on the reasons why the field continues to debate its identity and to voice concerns about its recognition by other disciplines.

Our second purpose is to derive some tentative, actionable recommendations for the field from applying the concepts presented in the first part of the paper.

Her multilayered framework could be extremely useful in overcoming a current limitation in IS: the weakness of reflexivity modeling. Indeed, though much research sheds light on the structure–action relationship, it does not illuminate users’ biographical realms and reflexivities. In consequence, some genuine motives in ICT-related practices remain poorly understood. To address this deficiency, this article applies Archer’s framework to an IS environment through a meta-analysis of interviews. Results partially confirm the relevance of internal conversation theory and its potential added value to the study of ICT-mediated interactions.

This paper examines the use of knowledge-sharing mechanisms to leverage the learning, experience and expertise of employees accumulated across projects. I specify a framework that classifies the knowledge-sharing mechanisms used by project-based organizations. Prior research tends to examine only one dimension of knowledge-sharing mechanisms – personalization versus codification. Personalization mechanisms are often assumed to be more ad hoc and informal, and codification mechanisms are assumed to be formal and involve the use of electronic databases. In this paper, personalization versus codification and individualization versus institutionalization are highlighted as two distinct dimensions of knowledge-sharing mechanisms. Individualized knowledge-sharing mechanisms are informal and unstructured, while institutionalized knowledge-sharing mechanisms are formal and embedded in organizational routines and structure.

Based on empirical case studies in two project-based organizations, the paper examines if there are suitable configurations of knowledge-sharing mechanisms for organizations with different characteristics.

Even within the small body of work that engages with emotions through particular conceptual efforts, affections are often conceived as a phenomenon to be eradicated – an affliction requiring a cure. In this paper, I argue that emotions are always implicated in our lived experiences, crucially influencing how we come to our beliefs about what is good or bad, right or wrong. I draw from the theoretical work of Michel Foucault to argue for elaborating current notions of IS innovation as a moral and political struggle in which individuals’ beliefs and feelings are constantly tested. Finally, I demonstrate these ideas by reference to a case study that had considerable emotional impact, and highlight the implications for future work.",[],Kathy McGrath,Kathy.McGrath@brunel.ac.uk,"School of Information Systems, Computing and Mathematics, Brunel University, Uxbridge, Middlesex, UK"

Indeed, a number of IS security researchers have turned their attention to the ‘insider’ threat. Of this group, several focus on the offender, either in terms of a series of attributes required for perpetration, or with reference to forms of safeguards aimed at negating such behaviour. These studies are complemented by those texts which examine the organisational context in which rogue employees commit computer crime. Currently, however, there has been a lack of insight into the relationship between the offender and the context, during the commission process. To address this deficiency, two criminological theories are advanced. This paper illustrates how the theories, entitled the Rational Choice Perspective and Situational Crime Prevention, can be applied to the IS domain, thereby offering a theoretical basis by which to analyse the offender/context relationship during perpetration. By so doing, practitioners may use these insights to inform and enhance the selection of safeguards in a bid to improve prevention programmes. Furthermore, the importation of the Rational Choice Perspective and Situational Crime Prevention into the IS field opens up potentially new areas for future research.",[],Robert Willison,rw.inf@cbs.dk,"Copenhagen Business School, Howitzvej 60, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark"

These inconsistencies are located between researchers’ stated (or implicit) ontological assumptions and research practice and results. Such a situation calls for a (re)consideration of the underlying ontological premises of information systems research and practice. This paper proposes that a critical realist ontology allows for one re-interpretation of the activity of science as implicitly predicated upon natural and social realism as well as the concepts of structures and generative mechanisms. This interpretation provides greater explanatory power vis-à-vis current research practices and resolves the theory-practice contradictions highlighted above. Consequently, it is a powerful logical argument for accepting this new conceptualization as an improvement upon the former. To illustrate, this paper recasts one such debate in light of critical realist assumptions; technological determinism vs. social construction of technology.",[],Matthew Longshore Smith,M.L.Smith1@lse.ac.uk,"The London School of Economics and Political Science, Department of Information Systems, Houghton Street, London WC2A 2AE, United Kingdom"

This research sought to address this gap, by adopting a semiotic framework of analysis, and undertaking an in-depth, interpretive case study of the customer service operations at the call center of a large retail firm. The analysis of these operations takes into account the call center’s ‘myth’ – the underlying image on which its customer service aim or vision is based. This myth is used to highlight key tensions and incompatibilities arising in the center’s operations. These incongruities are used to identify improvements in the effectiveness of the center’s service practices and its use of IT.

It is argued that the extant ISS methods reside on the first four generations, and future ISS methods should move towards the fifth generation, social and adaptable (empirically grounded) ISS methods.",[],Mikko T.

Drawing on Luhmann, traditional forms of technological control are analyzed in terms of functional simplification and closure. Functional simplification involves the demarcation of an operational domain within which the complexity of the world is reconstructed as a simplified set of causal or instrumental relations. Functional closure implies the construction of a protective cocoon that is placed around the selected causal sequences to ensure their recurrent unfolding. While possible to analyze in similar terms, current developments, as manifested in the diffusion of large-scale information systems and mostly the internet spin a web of technological relations that challenge the strategies of functional simplification and closure and the organizational practices that have traditionally accommodated them.",[],Jannis Kallinikos,j.kallinikos@lse.ac.uk,"Department of Information Systems, London School of Economics, Houghton Street, London WC2A 2AE, UK"

Communication technologies are often designed with the intention of improving work organization by reducing communication delays (first-order effect), but the use of these technologies may, in practice, inadvertently contribute to an increase in work interruptions (second-order effect).

Yet few empirical studies exist which examine how IS innovations come to be adopted and diffused across organizations. This paper draws from neo-institutional theory by extending the work of Swanson and Ramiller, using their concept of the organizing vision as a lens for observing and analysing an emerging information systems innovation targeted at small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which came to be known as application services provisioning (ASP). We observe that over time, the initial euphoria and ‘hype’ which surrounded the organizing vision of ASP was replaced by scepticism and distrust, as powerful institutional interests in the form of leading technology firms, industry analysts and IT consultancies were ultimately unsuccessful in their attempts to disseminate ASP throughout the wider business and not-for profit IS user communities. The lessons from this research suggest that a processes-oriented analysis of how organizing visions are interpreted, legitimised and mobilized is critical for understanding and explaining how underdevelopment of an organizing vision at an early stage, may inhibit its later adoption and institutionalization.",[],Wendy L.

Catalysed through processes of globalisation, the growth of cities, especially the so-called ‘mega-cities’, has not been matched by investments in infrastructure like roads and power due to the inability of local government organizations to collect adequate revenues from sources like property tax. Recognizing these difficulties, agencies such as the Asian Development Bank have initiated systems for property tax reforms in a number of Asian cities, including Bangalore.

This approach allows us to regard customer databases as configurations of language that produce new and significant discursive effects. In particular, we focus on the role of databases and related technologies such as customer relationship management (CRM) in the discursive construction of both customers and customer relationships. First, we argue that organizations become the authors of customer identities, using the language of the database to configure customer representation. From this perspective, we can see the radical innovation that the customer database brings to the organizational construction of its market: the emergence of the individualized customer. The cultural novelty of the database—ignored by instrumental analyses of information technology—also requires a theoretical reconceptualization of the notion of virtual identity. Against existing positions, we posit a non-essentialist theory of virtual identity where the subject is constituted outside the immediacy of consciousness and thus emerges as the result of the technological and linguistic context in which it was produced. Second, we take our analysis of the discursive construction of the customer further by proposing that the emergence of the individualized customer was the prerequisite of the social construction of CRM as one-on-one affair between the customer and the organization. We suggest that this is a limited and limiting understanding of the concept of customer relationships especially if the one-on-one relationship is placed in a computer-mediated environment (CME). By mobilizing theories of play developed in the fields of human–computer interaction and consumer research, we propose that organizations would benefit from opening up the current discourse on CRM to include relationships between customers, customers and non-customers, and customers and the virtual organization.",[],Detlev Zwick,N/A,"Marketing Department, Schulich School of Business, York University, 4700 Keele Street, Toronto, Ont., Canada M3J 1P3"

It is suggested that, rather than being a relatively-enduring property of individuals, based on their mastery of a body abstract knowledge or their skills at managing the perceptions of their clients, the precarious and multi-faceted character of their expertise means that consultants are continuously engaged in its active construction through their situated practice.",[],Matthew Jones,m.jones@jims.cam.ac.uk,"Judge Institute of Management, University of Cambridge, Trumpington Street, Cambridge CB2 1AG, Cambridge, UK"

This paper analyzes one of the first Enterprise Resource Planning implementation projects within the academic administration of an Ivy League university. We contribute to existing qualitative literature in information systems by developing the theme of temporality within actor–network theory to support our analysis. This enables us to extend process-oriented ERP research by focusing on the identification of temporal zones and creation of durable work times designed to re-order priorities between competing visions for the future of higher education. We analyze detailed negotiations during periods of controversy to reveal how standard work practices come to be created and recreated. We consider how the ERP that emerges is affected by progressive trials of strength during the project and analyze the achievement of order as an on-going process. Our findings highlight the distinctive contribution that a ‘temporal turn’ can bring to longitudinal research studies by providing insight into the technical agency of ERP packages and how its temporal inscriptions shaped the emergence of a socio-technical information system.

How do the coordination mechanisms evolve during a project, and why? Coordination mechanisms were classified into standards, plans, formal mutual adjustment, and informal mutual adjustment. Two studies were conducted, including seven and four cases from vendor and client perspectives, respectively. Based on these cases, the coordination mechanisms used in outsourced IS projects are examined, factors influencing the evolution of coordination mechanisms are identified, and a model of evolution of coordination is developed. The cases also revealed three scenarios for the evolution of coordination (non-coordination, consistent coordination, late coordination). The results show the client as pulling the outsourcing relationship toward a hierarchy structure, characterized by informal mutual adjustment, while the vendor pulls the relationship toward a market structure, characterized by standards, plans, and formal mutual adjustment.

Drawing on a historical case study, it examines the rise of actuarial theory in Germany and Switzerland around 1900 and its significance for the emergence of the first modern social insurances. So far, the history of actuarial theory has been written as the social history of the actuarial profession or the epistemic history of probability calculus. By examining the political and economic contexts of the history of actuarial theory, the article also discusses the notion of an “insurance society”. The argument concludes that Foucauldian interpretations of actuarial theory as a technology of power and a condition of modern governmentality are too monistic and should be specified. The article suggests to use the concept of a “technology of trust” to interpret the integrative power of actuarial theory in a political field marked by deep antagonisms.",[],Martin Lengwiler,N/A,"Center for Social and Economic History, University of Zurich, Raemistrasse 64, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland"

Therefore, researchers have emphasized the need to identify methods that can enhance users’ intentions to use a system. Training programs are viewed as one avenue to improve users’ intentions to use a system. Two important goals of a training program are to enhance a trainee’s intentions to use the target system and improve their level of system proficiency. This study postulates that the Theory of Planned Behavior could be used to guide the development of belief manipulation pre-training scripts. These pre-training scripts can be used to positively influence trainees’ beliefs regarding the target system leading to higher intentions to use the system and in improved levels of system proficiency. The results of a controlled laboratory experiment indicate that subjects who received the belief manipulation pre-training script showed significantly higher intentions to use the target system when compared to subjects who did not. The belief manipulation pre-training scripts, however, did not seem to improve the level of system proficiency of trainees.",[],R.

Consequently, many new forms of organizing have been proffered. In particular, new-form theorists acknowledge hierarchy but rarely test it in generating a variety of information technology- (IT) related change outcomes. This paper focuses on the robustness of hierarchy by tracing its characteristics within two public organizations. It provides an understanding of the relationship between IT applications and structural change by examining how the process of IT adaptation unfolds. Specifically, it explores how management’s disposition to IT change discerns the nature of an organization’s structure and the adaptation of that structure. I argue that the nature of management’s application of information systems—and non-management’s reaction to this practice—guides structural modification. Discussion focuses on explaining the continued presence of hierarchy in IT environments where there is an expectation for significant structural change.",[],G.M.

Drawing on recent debates concerning knowledge and identity within social anthropology, IS and social psychology, this approach derives from a theoretical position which acknowledges social constraints on individual behaviour whilst according primacy to individuals’ biographically determined interpretive work. Use of this approach in the field revealed layers of interpretive interaction between users and technology which had hitherto remained invisible and problematic, and allowed several simple practical interventions which strengthened the ability of users to generate their own meanings at critical junctures in the system. It is suggested that such sensitive, low-level ‘fine tuning’ represents a new way forward for those seeking a practical, focused alternative to the more commonplace, high-level research approach within current interpretive IS literature.",[],M.P.A Thompson,mpat2@cam.ac.uk,"Judge Institute of Management Studies, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1AG, UK"

The paper will support the supposition of Don Caputo that obligation does not emanate from codes, imperatives or moral arguments. Rather it will argue that obligation takes hold of us from within disaster. Obligation, our being bound-to, finds us when we come face to a face in disaster. The paper will argue that electronic mediation is inducing a sense of hyperreality into our world (Baudrillard). It will argue that this hyperreality is making our ethical sensibility nebulous to the point that we are not coming face to face with our obligations. An analysis of the Baring bank disaster will be used to demonstrate the point. The paper will show that Nick Leeson was in a hyperreal world in which he was not able to come face to face with the victims of the disaster. The electronic hyperreal world of financial markets, where traders deal in abstract numbers, movements on the screen, made it possible for him to look over and past the faces and proper names of the victims; their claim became diffused in the numbers on the screen, not real cash only numbers, not real people with faces and proper names, just numbers. If this supposition seems tenable what are we to do? The paper argues that we do not need more codes, imperatives or moral arguments, as such.

In the literature on engineers' information-seeking practices the generally agreed-upon explanation of this preference for close-by, internal information sources is that engineers follow a principle of least effort by choosing their information sources on the basis of ease of access rather than quality of contents. This study argues that engineers' preference for internal sources such as their colleagues is just as much a preference for sources with a known or easily determinable trustworthiness as it is a preference for information that is easily accessible. Trust is of central importance because quality is a perceived property and, thus, assessing the quality of an information source is essentially a matter of establishing to what extent one is willing to place trust in it. This can be done with greater ease and precision for familiar sources. A field study of the meetings in a software design project shows that in discussing and selecting information sources the software engineers devote significantly more attention to quality-related factors than to cost-related factors. It is also normal conversational practice at the meetings to accompany the mentioning of information sources that may be unknown to some project participants by information that puts them in context.

Such views are prevalent in professional and more popular literature, and even in policy documents, albeit expressed tacitly. Adopting this standpoint substantially reduces explanatory power in relation to certain computer ethics topics, especially equality and participation, particularly in relation to gender. Research on gender and information and communications technologies has analyzed inequalities between men and women both inside and outside the workplace, drawing heavily from feminist theory. The paper argues that feminist ethics, coupled with aspects of feminist legal and political theory, may offer a fruitful, novel direction for analyzing computer ethics problems, and certainly those that contain substantial differences, and therefore inequalities, in men's and women's experiences on-line. Furthermore, feminist ethics can offer a more collectivist approach toward computer ethics problems.

We believe paying attention to such metaphors is important because in the absence of experiences (direct or vicarious) to guide practice, the images and ideals promoted in the discourse will shape people's views of and actions towards this new way of organizing. As such, metaphors play a powerful role in structuring the reality of virtuality. To understand the kind of reality being imagined and incited, we examine the various metaphors being proposed in the practitioner-directed literature on virtual organizing. We find that this discourse contains a multiplicity of different metaphors, each highlighting and hiding distinct aspects of virtual organizing. We identify five overarching metaphors in this discourse. These metaphors (re)present virtual organizing as a platform, as existing in space, as composed of bits, as operating as a community, and as engaging in a network of relationships. We analyze these metaphors in terms of their assumptions and presumptions about how to organize work, as well as their affordances and challenges. We conclude by considering what the consequences might be for people acting on the basis of such different, and often contradictory, metaphors in practice.",[],Ulrike Schultze,uschultz@mail.cox.smu.edu,"Cox School of Business, Southern Methodist University, P.O.
