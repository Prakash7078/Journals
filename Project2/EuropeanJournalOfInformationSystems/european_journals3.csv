In particular, the enhancement of electricity systems through IT components, resulting in smart grid and smart home solutions, is experiencing increasing adoption rates in advanced and developing countries alike. Due to the substantial interdependence with and reliance on often decades-old legacy infrastructure, these cyberphysical systems present particular opportunities and challenges for the associated information systems. We propose that one channel through which information systems improve cyberphysical systems is by enhancing the components of the legacy system with new features. Introducing the Design–Interference Model, we conceptualize IS design for cyberphysical systems and outline possible obstacles and interferences associated with it. Using a simulation experiment for a smart grid application as a showcase, we derive insights into how to address these challenges. We condense these results into actionable advice that, first, seeks to validate existing guidelines for design-oriented research, second, extends and focuses them on cyberphysical system applications and, third, provides guidance to researchers and practitioners in this increasingly relevant area of information system development.","['Design science', 'cyberphysical Systems', 'design-interference model', 'smart grid', 'sustainability']",N/A,N/A,N/A,

We identify initial design principles based on salient affordances required in organisational sensemaking and revise them through three rounds of developing, demonstrating and evaluating a prototypical implementation. Through our analysis, we learn how IS can support essential sensemaking practices in environmental sustainability transformations, including experiencing disruptive ambiguity through the provision of environmental data, noticing and bracketing, engaging in an open and inclusive communication and presuming potential alternative environmentally responsible actions. We make two key contributions: First, we provide a set of theory-inspired design principles for IS that support sensemaking in sustainability transformations, and revise them empirically using a DSR method. Second, we show how the concept of affordances can be used in DSR to investigate how IS can support organisational practices. While our findings are based on the investigation of the substantive context of environmental sustainability transformation, we suggest that they might be applicable in a broader set of contexts of organisational sensemaking and thus for a broader class of sensemaking support systems.","['Sensemaking', 'sustainability', 'green IS', 'design science research']",N/A,N/A,N/A,

Findings here, indicate that prior exchanges are not needed to access and utilise OHC community resources. However, trust (developed through prior exchanges) is required for a recipient to leverage the contributor’s social capital for information adoption and relational closeness. These findings allow the distribution of social capital to be viewed in terms of an asymmetrical model where it is possible to accept capital, in the form of advice, without first demonstrating trustworthiness. In the OHC setting the onus is on the contributor of advice to establish trustworthiness, whereas traditionally social capital theory requires receivers of capital to establish trust.

However, because users of these forums tend not to have formal medical training, they often cannot verify objectively the soundness of the advice provided. Thus, there is a need to understand better the mechanism through which people trust and utilise information found on these forums. In testing a theory-based trust model, we find that forum users accept advice more readily as they develop cognitive trust (trust based on a cognitive assessment) and/or affective trust (trust based on an emotional connection). Affective trust is also closely related to formation of relational closeness. This indicates that, while both forms of trust are important, the development of emotional connections provides for long-term OHCs interactions.

Termed personally identifiable information (PII), this information has become the lifeblood of many firms across the globe. As organisations accumulate their constituencies’ PII (e.g. customers’, students’, patients’, and employees’ data), individuals’ privacy will depend on the adequacy of organisations’ information privacy safeguards. Despite existing protections, many breaches still occur. For example, US organisations reported around 4,500 PII-breach events between 2005 and 2015. With such a high number of breaches, determining all threats to PII within organisations proves a burdensome task. In light of this difficulty, we utilise text-mining and cluster analysis techniques to create a taxonomy of various organisational PII breaches, which will help drive targeted research towards organisational PII protection. From an organisational systematics perspective, our classification system provides a foundation to explain the diversity among the myriad of threats. We identify eight major PII-breach types and provide initial literature reviews for each type of breach. We detail how US organisations differ regarding their exposure to these breaches, as well as how the level of severity (i.e. number of records affected) differs among these PII breaches. Finally, we offer several paths for future research.","['personally identifiable information (PII)', 'breach analysis', 'taxonomy development', 'privacy', 'confidentiality']",A. J.

The findings reveal that CEO fixed pay and bonus negatively affect the execution of the two types of IT-based environmental strategies, green IT strategies and IT-enabled green strategies, whereas CEO stock option positively influences such execution. The moderation analysis further highlights that while competitive intensity reinforces the positive impact of CEO stock option on both strategies, it weakens the negative impact of CEO fixed pay and bonus only on IT-enabled green strategies. The findings suggest that a highly competitive operating setting represents an ideal setting for using stock option to motivate CEOs to execute these two strategies. At the minimum, this setting helps mitigate the deterrent effect of fixed pay and bonus on CEOs’ execution of IT-enabled green strategies. The findings also suggest that firms should align their CEO compensation package with the characteristics of high uncertainty and long payback periods of IT-based environmental strategic endeavors and the competitive conditions they face.","['CEO compensation', 'agency theory', 'IT-based environmental strategies', 'competitive intensity']",Ricky Y.

Unfortunately, current models of trust and distrust have limitations that impede explanations of how – or even if – ambivalence is generated by feelings of trust and distrust and how these two constructs can best coexist. We thus propose a hybrid model which considers the limitations and strengths of previous models. Namely, we posit that trust and distrust can coexist as separate components with related continua. We use polynomial regression analysis (PRA) and response surface analysis (RSA) to test these complex relationships. Using an empirical study of online consumer behaviour with 521 experienced online consumers, strong empirical validation is found for the model. We examine the effects of ambivalence on the truster’s intentions towards a website and find a small positive effect which increases such intentions. PRA and RSA confirm that trust and distrust are most likely separate components – not opposite ends of a continuum – with related continua.

2010) call for research on experiential computing, the paper suggests meditations as a genre for both doing and reporting on fieldwork. Meditations are used to engender passionate renderings of research encounters that are part introspective and reflective and part causative and instructive. The meditations weave together everyday experiences with IT with theoretical reflections on embodiment and affect, and suggest the potential for a new scholarly sensuousness. The paper suggests that paying attention to feelings related to technology in everyday life and the use of alternative representational tactics and theoretical motifs can be generative of new matters for empirical research. Emphasizing the senses and the body and their importance in developing a sensory apprenticeship in IS, the paper suggests alternative routes to knowledge and representation.","['affect', 'embodiment', 'experience', 'methods']",Mads Bødker,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/B%C3%B8dker%2C+Mads,"Department of IT ManagementCopenhagen Business School Howitzvej 60, 5, Frederiksberg 2000CopenhagenDenmark

For this, it invites explorations on the role of the body and its affective propulsions as the locus of human experience. I argue, in this article, that this embodied perspective, studied through the lens of enchanted materialism (Bennett in The enchantment of modern life: attachments, crossings, and ethics. Princeton University Press, Princeton,
2001), needs to be combined with an alternative writing genre to fruitfully explore life in experiential computing. It is for this reason that I present my research as a memoir on the use of wearables – an instantiation of the Internet of Things – in everyday life. The aim is to show that, when studying emerging technologies, an open-ended non-fictional genre like the memoir can produce astute and imaginative insights that may be as informative as traditional academic writing. The memoir produces a thick description of the way people interact with digital devices in experiential computing; their expectations and the subsequent effort to entangle the data in their daily lives. This way, it problematises current organising visions of a data-driven life. I conclude the article with reflections on the contribution that enchanted materialism makes to information systems, as well as the memoir’s potential for academic research.","['memoir', 'human body', 'experiential computing', 'enchanted materialism', 'wearables', 'Internet of Things']",Elpida Prasopoulou,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Prasopoulou%2C+Elpida,"Centre for Business in SocietyCoventry University Priory Street CV1 5FBCoventryUK

In writing them, researchers move beyond the “realistic” tale to frame coherent organizational metaphors and symbols and to offer a multi-layered truth that lies “between the lines” in the often subconscious spaces of organizational life. As such, this genre offers an evocative, yet concise alternative to traditional approaches for information systems research. Drawing on a 2-year cultural study of strategic alignment of IT in two insurance organizations as illustrative context, the allegory is introduced and demonstrated in five steps to guide researchers in creating their own allegories. This illustration uses allegory to recast diverse cultural and historical data into short stories that involve magic dragons and wizards, thereby demonstrating the usefulness of the genre for comparative, multi-case designs to translate organizational features to achieve a common representation. In conclusion, the paper offers reflections on how the genre of allegory may contribute to future information systems research, to alternative styles of presentation, and to reflexive practices.","['allegory', 'IT Culture', 'IT alignment', 'magic', 'metaphor and symbols', 'writing qualitative research']",Michelle Lynn Kaarst-Brown,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Kaarst-Brown%2C+Michelle+Lynn,"School of Information StudiesSyracuse University 218 Hinds Hall 13244SyracuseNYUSA

Public entities search for a resolution of this dialectic through two syntheses: selecting an appropriate tendering procedure, and learning how to specify requirements through networks of peer public entities. Our findings reveal that the syntheses are possible because the dialectic is actually complimentary, both the thesis and the antithesis are needed to create the joint outcome that satisfies both.

Yet despite much investigation, the effect of strategic IT alignment on organizational performance remains unclear, with mixed results reported in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to advance our understanding of mixed findings in IT alignment research. We first examine inconsistent findings reported in two streams of alignment research: the traditional firm-level IT alignment literature and the emerging literature into process-level IT alignment. We then empirically investigate whether firm- and process-level conceptualizations of IT alignment lead to different conclusions about the effect of alignment on performance. Using data from a survey of 120 firms, we show that firm-level IT alignment and process-level IT alignment yield different conclusions when testing the same theory under the same conditions. We also show that differences in firms’ strategic orientations can help explain these results. This research provides evidence that firm- and process-level conceptualizations of IT alignment are not interchangeable and that the choice of conceptualization can mean the difference between accepting and rejecting a theory.","['IT alignment', 'profile deviation', 'construct conceptualization', 'mixed results', 'strategic orientation', 'performance']",Magno Queiroz,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Queiroz%2C+Magno,"Management Information Systems, Jon M.

To address this research conflict, this study uses an interpretive grounded theory research approach to investigate the consequences of privacy safeguard enactment in medical practices, including whether it influences their ability to meet privacy requirements and whether workflows are impeded. Our central contribution is a theoretical framework, the unintended consequences of privacy safeguard enactment (UCPSE) framework, which explicates the process by which privacy safeguards are evaluated and subsequently bypassed and the resulting influence on organisational compliance. The UCPSE highlights the importance of the imbalance challenge, which is the result of unintended consequences outweighing the intended consequences of privacy safeguard enactment.

We discuss the lessons and contributions related to research on IS business cases and value creation.","['business cases', 'action research', 'IS management', 'IS value', 'IS benefits management', 'project management']",John Stouby Persson,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Persson%2C+John+Stouby,"Research Centre for Socio-Interactive DesignAalborg University Selma Lagerlöfsvej 300 9220AalborgDenmark

We do so in the context of online opinion sharing. We propose that the unique design features of mobile computing devices and the intention and purpose of their users, meld into a technology affordance we label: Triggered essential reviewing. We empirically investigate the effect of this technology affordance on opinion characteristics (i.e., timing and length), and outcomes (i.e., opinion valence and content). We find that triggered essential reviewing engenders opinions that cover a narrower range of aspects of the experience and that it produces a negative evaluative bias—a bias that mitigates over time. Our work makes two contributions to the application of affordance theory in Information Systems. First, it shows the importance of IT design in studying experiential computing. While not taking a deterministic view of technology, we validate the notion that different technology designs produce a variation of effects around a predictable central tendency. Second, it empirically demonstrates that the affordances of embodied digital experiences have an effect on actual behavior as well as on the outcome of the experience itself.","['technology affordance', 'mobile devices', 'user-generated content', 'opinion platforms']",Gabriele Piccoli,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Piccoli%2C+Gabriele,"Louisiana State University Rm 2217 Business Education Complex, Nicholson Drive Extension 70803Baton RougeLAUSA

Second, we propose that for a network organization, network and member strategies might be complementary as well as tightly coupled.

Synthesizing the extant literature on information management and information orientation, we further conceptualize PIMM as having four sub-dimensions of proactiveness, sharing, transparency, and formality, and PIMC as possessing five sub-dimensions of sensing, collecting, organizing, processing, and maintaining. Moreover, we develop a theoretical model that positions PIME as a mediator between two selected individual characteristics (IT self-efficacy and need-for-cognition) and job performance. New measures for PIME dimensions were developed and shown to have strong psychometric properties. The proposed model was empirically tested using data collected from 352 knowledge workers. As theorized, PIME was found to have significant effects on job performance (41%) and fully mediate the effects that the selected individual characteristics have on job performance. Responding to recent calls for advanced research on personal information management, the measures of PIMM and PIMC developed in this study have practical value as research and diagnostic tools and the findings provide useful insights to help organizations improve knowledge workers’ information management practices.","['personal information management effectiveness', 'knowledge management', 'questionnaire survey', 'need-for-cognition', 'self-efficacy', 'job performance']",Yujong Hwang,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Hwang%2C+Yujong,"School of Accountancy and MIS, Driehause College of Business, DePaul UniversityChicagoILU.S.A.;College of International Studies, Kyung Hee UniversityYonginRepublic of Korea

We extend this literature by examining theory building perspectives. We define a perspective as a researcher’s choice of the types of concepts and relationships used to construct a theory, and we examine three perspectives – process, variance, and systems. We contribute by clarifying these perspectives and explaining how they can be used more flexibly in future research. We illustrate the value of this more flexible approach by showing how researchers can use different theoretical perspectives to critique and extend an existing theoretical model (in our case, the IS Success Model). Overall, we suggest a shift from the traditional process-variance dichotomy to a broader view defined by conceptual latitude (the types of concepts and relationships available) and conceptual fit (the types of concepts and relationships appropriate for a given study). We explain why this shift should help researchers as they engage in the knowledge generation process.","['theory', 'methodology', 'process', 'variance', 'system', 'epistemology']",Pär J Ågerfalk,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/%C3%85gerfalk%2C+P%C3%A4r+J,"Department of Informatics and MediaUppsala UniversityUppsalaSweden

Much has transpired in the quarter of a century since its publication, which provides us with new sources of understanding about paradigms and how they relate to the challenges faced by the IS field. On the basis of the hermeneutical principles of tradition, prejudice, temporal distance, history of effect and application, this study describes the context from which B&L was written, its dependence on Whitley’s (1984) The Intellectual and Social Organization of the Sciences, and examines several of its claims and assertions. In contrast to B&L, this study finds the Kuhnian model of scientific progress well suited for a multidisciplinary and pluralistic field like IS and concludes with guidelines on how to reclaim the more transformative aspects of the paradigm concept, engender a culture of contextual borrowing from reference disciplines, and encourage conceptual development and autonomous theory construction.","['information systems (IS) disciplinarity', 'IS theory', 'IS philosophy', 'hermeneutics', 'Kuhnian paradigms and normal science', 'sociology of science and knowledge.']",Nik R Hassan,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Hassan%2C+Nik+R,"University of Minnesota DuluthDuluthMNU.S.A.

We investigate this question using data from 165 hotels affiliated with two brands of an international lodging chain. We study the effect of successful use and unreliability of an incremental IT-enabled self-service channel on overall CP. We find that the effect of the incremental service channel depends on the firm’s organizational resources. We also show that different organizations experience significantly different use and unreliability rates. Further, we find that the positive association between the use of an IT-enabled self-service channel and CP endures over a 2-year period, despite competitors’ widespread adoption of the technology enabling the incremental service channel (self-service kiosks). Our findings corroborate research on the strategic role of IT resources when appropriately coupled with complementary resources. They lead us to question the notion that IT is a strategic commodity. Indeed, the findings suggest that IT-dependent strategic initiatives have the potential to generate sustained CP, even when the technology that enables them appears ‘simple’.

However, while technology becomes more and more pervasive, an age-related underutilisation of IT remains observable. For instance, elderly people (65 years of age and older) are significantly less likely to use the Internet than the average population (see, for instance, European Commission, 2011). This age-related digital divide prevents many elderly people from using IT to enhance their quality of life through tools, such as Internet-based service delivery. Despite the significance of this phenomenon, the information systems (IS) literature lacks a comprehensive consideration and explanation of technology acceptance in general and more specifically, Internet adoption by the elderly. This paper thus studies the intentions of the elderly with regard to Internet use and identifies important influencing factors. Four alternative models based on technology acceptance theory are tested in the context of comprehensive survey data. As a result, a model that explains as much as 84% of the variance in technology adoption among the elderly is developed. We discuss the contribution of our analyses to the research on Internet adoption (and IT adoption in general) by the elderly, on the digital divide, and on technology acceptance and identify potentially effective paths for future research and theoretical development.","['elderly', 'digital divide', 'technology acceptance', 'Internet adoption']",Björn Niehaves,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Niehaves%2C+Bj%C3%B6rn,"Hertie School of GovernanceBerlinGermany

For instance, elderly people (65 years of age and older) are significantly less likely to use the Internet than the average population (see, for instance, European Commission, 2011). This age-related digital divide prevents many elderly people from using IT to enhance their quality of life through tools, such as Internet-based service delivery. Despite the significance of this phenomenon, the information systems (IS) literature lacks a comprehensive consideration and explanation of technology acceptance in general and more specifically, Internet adoption by the elderly. This paper thus studies the intentions of the elderly with regard to Internet use and identifies important influencing factors. Four alternative models based on technology acceptance theory are tested in the context of comprehensive survey data. As a result, a model that explains as much as 84% of the variance in technology adoption among the elderly is developed. We discuss the contribution of our analyses to the research on Internet adoption (and IT adoption in general) by the elderly, on the digital divide, and on technology acceptance and identify potentially effective paths for future research and theoretical development.","['elderly', 'digital divide', 'technology acceptance', 'Internet adoption']",Ralf Plattfaut,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Plattfaut%2C+Ralf,"Hertie School of GovernanceBerlinGermany;University of Muenster – European Research Center for Information SystemsMünsterGermany

We present and analyse empirical data from a case in which electronic ordering in the Australian pharmaceutical industry evolved over a 30-year period from closed to quasi-open systems. We analyse this revelatory case using a practice-theoretical framework to make visible the phenomenon of IOIS evolution. An essential characteristic of this framework is the distinction between and symmetrical treatment of material, normative and ideational structures within the practices that constitute the IOIS. Against the findings of this case study, we then evaluate two promising models of long-term IS change, namely Porra's (1999) Colonial Systems model and Lyytinen and Newman's (2008) Punctuated Socio-technical IS Change model. These models are selected as highly elaborated IS exemplars of two classes of theories of organizational change, namely evolutionary and dialectical theories. We find that these two models can only partially explain our findings. Finally, we make suggestions for developing more comprehensive theoretical models within these two classes of IS change theories. In practical terms, our paper shows that the transformation from closed to open IOIS may require adoption of longer time frames than are usually assumed and closer attention to norms and rationales usually neglected in IS projects.","['inter-organizational information systems (IOIS)', 'systems evolution', 'long-term IS change', 'Colonial Systems model', 'Punctuated Socio-technical IS Change model', 'practice theory']",Stefan Klein,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Klein%2C+Stefan,"School of Business and Economics, University of MünsterMünsterGermany

In this opinion article, we outline five guidelines – relating to both rigor and relevance – designed to increase the contextual relevance of field survey research, using case examples from the area of IS security. They are: (1) inform study respondents that a behavior is an ISP violation, (2) measure specific examples of ISP violations, (3) ensure that ISP violations are important ISP problems in practice, (4) ensure the applicability of IS security violations to the organizational context, and (5) consider the appropriate level of specificity and generalizability for instrumentation. We review previous behavioral research on IS security and show that no existing study meets more than three of these five guidelines.

The search for consensus among executivesâ€™ perceptions of IT business value,Issue 3,"Volume 23, 2014 - Issue 3","Since firms rarely collect data on the precise economic or financial impacts of information technology (IT), perceptions play a key role in assessing IT impacts. To the extent that executives in the same firm evaluate IT impacts similarly, it can be easier to approve future IT investments or to initiate corrective action for failing IT investments. In this study, we use distributed sensemaking theory to investigate the conditions under which executives will reach a consensus as to the extent and locus of firm and process-level IT impacts in their firm. Using data from surveys of 133 top-level business executives in 13 firms, we show that consensus is a function of CIO-led sensegiving in the form of IT promotion, CIO leadership, information systems (IS) engagement with end users, and IS-business communications. The absence of consensus – discord – suggests IS disengagement, a lack of effective CIO leadership, weak IT-business communications, and ineffective promotion of the role of IT. Sensegiving does not mean telling executives what to think about IT but rather how to think about IT and its impacts at various points within the firm. Whether IT impacts are rated high or low, efforts to create increased consensus among executives can greatly enhance value from IT.","['executive perceptions', 'sensemaking', 'sensegiving', 'consensus', 'IT impacts', 'binary logit regression']",Paul P Tallon,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Tallon%2C+Paul+P,"Information Systems and Operations Management, Sellinger School of Business and Management, Loyola UniversityBaltimoreMDUSA

Furthermore, drawing upon these two different styles in combination within the confines of a single project creates tensions. We explore these tensions and present an illustrative example of how IS project managers can deal with these tensions successfully in practice.

Synthesizing key findings from IT adoption and post-adoption research, switching research, and cloud computing studies, it builds an integrative framework of cloud migration using migration theory as a theoretical lens, and postulates interdependencies among these predictors. A longitudinal survey of Google Apps adoption among student subjects in South Korea validates our proposed model.

Walsham's paper, along with his further work, represents a cornerstone of the discourse surrounding interpretive research. It has set the tone for further publications in the area and has more recently been followed up by a detailed practical account of how to undertake interpretive research by the same author. Using Walsham's position as a starting point, the present paper questions some basic assumptions of interpretivism. Drawing on the philosophical background of interpretivism in hermeneutics and phenomenology, the paper questions the status of empirical research in the interpretivist tradition. Using quality criteria of different research streams related to interpretivism, the paper compares the role of empirical data in different types of research accounts with fairy tales, noting that interpretive IS research shares at least as many quality features with fairy tales as with positivist narratives. The paper concludes by discussing which consequences this position has for interpretive and other research in IS.","['interpretivism', 'critical theory', 'hermeneutics', 'phenomenology', 'empiricism', 'fairy tales']",Bernd Carsten Stahl,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Stahl%2C+Bernd+Carsten,"Department of Informatics, De Montfort University, UK

Stahl calls for a wider range and quantity of non-empirical approaches. I am broadly supportive of this call but, in this response, I also argue for the value of studies based on empirical data. In addition, I think that Stahl overstates his empiricist case somewhat and I identify a range of existing non-empirical genres of publication including theoretical papers, literature reviews, polemics and future-oriented speculations. However, I do like the idea of extending non-empirical approaches and I suggest some ideas for the future including short stories and novels, plays and artistic comparisons. I end with a brief discussion of the feasibility of such ideas bearing in mind the politics of academic publishing.","['IS field', 'interpretive research', 'empirical studies', 'non-emprical approaches', 'academic publishing']",Geoff Walsham,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Walsham%2C+Geoff,"Cambridge University, Judge Business School, Cambridge, UK

Several more or less successful federated identity management systems have emerged to support authentication across diverse service domains in recent years. In this paper, we explore the determinants for success and failure of such systems with a focus on Germany representing one of the largest markets in Europe.

This article aims to deepen understanding of the processes by which technology and identity co-evolve in the IT assimilation process over time. The proposed alternative framework relies on the philosophy of Michel Foucault, applied to a longitudinal, qualitative case study of a French company involved in the deployment of a geolocation technology. The analysis reveals diverse patterns of interaction among the managerial discourses used to shape technicians' ascribed identity and the identity that technicians design for themselves, which then result in distinct IT assimilation types that contribute to the further evolution of their identity.","['identity', 'technology', 'assimilation', 'identification', 'discourse', 'Michel Foucault']",Aurélie Leclercq-Vandelannoitte,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Leclercq-Vandelannoitte%2C+Aur%C3%A9lie,"IESEG School of Management, Lille, France

The empirical basis of this work comes from case studies of integrated criminal justice information systems (IJIS). IJIS are organizational and technological ensembles created to facilitate inter-organizational information sharing among criminal justice agencies. The focus of these case studies was to examine how organizational identity shapes organizational ICT. This research found that organizational identity shapes an organization's ICT-related processes and is reflected in the material configurations of an organization's ICT; and that organizations with different identities exhibit those differences in their ICT. Three implications of this research are that organizational identity serves as both an enabler and constraint on organizational ICT development; organizational identity commitments will likely serve as a barrier to large-scale integration of different organizations' systems; organizational identity is relatively static and difficult to change.,"['green is', 'organisational & inter-organisational initiatives', 'social/organisational aspects of is']",Michael Tyworth,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Tyworth%2C+Michael,"Penn State University Park, U.S.A.

The analysis, performed on survey data from 75 enterprises, supports all of our hypotheses.

Second, IS application integration and cross-BU relatedness should both directly contribute to knowledge sharing.

Finally, and most interestingly, we hypothesized a redistribution of the effects of IS integration by which it becomes a key contributor to knowledge sharing, but also causes a reduction in the impact of workflow interdependence.

Specifically, both requirements risk and user risk were found to reduce the positive influence of controls on process performance, implying that implementing solid controls is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition to ensure good process performance.","['IT project management', 'formal and informal controls', 'requirements risk', 'user risk', 'process performance']",Shan Liu,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Liu%2C+Shan,"School of Management, Huazhong University of Science and TechnologyWuhanChina

A key grammatical construct of such grammars is known as a Gateway. A Gateway construct is used to describe scenarios in which the workflow of a process diverges or converges according to relevant conditions. Gateway constructs have been subjected to much academic discussion about their meaning, role and usefulness, and have been linked to both process-modeling errors and process-model understandability. This paper examines perceptual discriminability effects of Gateway constructs on an individual's abilities to interpret process models. We compare two ways of expressing two convergence and divergence patterns – Parallel Split and Simple Merge – implemented in a process modeling grammar. On the basis of an experiment with 98 students, we provide empirical evidence that Gateway constructs aid the interpretation of process models due to a perceptual discriminability effect, especially when models are complex. We discuss the emerging implications for research and practice, in terms of revisions to grammar specifications, guideline development and design choices in process modeling.","['process modeling', 'visual expressiveness', 'process model comprehension', 'Gateway constructs']",Jan Recker,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Recker%2C+Jan,"Queensland University of TechnologyQLDAustralia

Many networks govern through an infomediary (i.e., electronic broker) that brings together disparate member organizations. These networks can resemble an enterprise where standards and incentives for use are imposed on its partners. This study seeks to extend an enterprise IT governance (ITG) concept to the U.S. e-prescribing network as it transitions from a paper-based network to a computer-mediated one. The operating model, proposed by Ross et al (2006), emphasizes choices in standardization and integration to align strategy with operational processes to improve enterprise performance. Missing in their work is evidence that macro-level choices embedded in the operating model directly impact network workflow. A comparative synthesis traces the changes made to the U.S. e-prescribing operating model to their impact upon the roles and relationships among network members. Some workflow mis-alignments were traceable to the operating philosophy imposed by healthcare policy-makers. The study suggests IT alignment in networks may be better achieved through governing operating models rather than the traditional ITG focus on organizational forms.","['healthcare information systems', 'IT governance', 'system design', 'operating model', 'inter-organizational network', 'workflow']",Nelson King,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/King%2C+Nelson,"Business Information & Decision Systems, Olayan School of Business, American University of BeirutBeirutLebanon

From the perspective of vendor organizations in India, however, the IT offshoring phenomenon is more than just a business relationship with Western firms. It is also embedded within the context of the longstanding imbalances of power in the relationship between the West and the East, the implications of which have been largely ignored in empirical work on offshoring within the information systems (IS) discipline. Drawing on concepts from postcolonial theory and using data from our ethnographic fieldwork, we explore the experiences and responses of one Indian vendor organization to asymmetries of power in its relationship with Western client organizations. Our analysis demonstrates how a postcolonial reading and interpretation of IT offshoring adds an important new dimension to previous IS research and also helps to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the strategies deployed by vendor organizations.","['critical research', 'IT offshoring', 'postcolonial theory', 'India', 'ethnography']",Michael D Myers,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Myers%2C+Michael+D,,

Importantly, as business users continually gain experience with enterprise systems and a new generation of tech-savvy workers enters the labour force, IT competence is increasingly distributed beyond the IS department. Despite its strategic potential however, IT competence residing within the functional areas of the firm is essentially untapped until it is volunteered by functional area knowledge workers. Addressing the changing landscape of IT competence across the enterprise, the current study examines factors that drive business professionals to volunteer their IT competences to the firm. This research introduces the concept of IT competence volunteering, which is conceptualized as a form of organizational citizenship behaviour that is not explicitly contracted by the firm and may not be directly rewarded. Guided by social exchange theory, a multi-foci model is introduced that positions IT competence as well as workplace exchange relationships as antecedents of IT competence volunteering intention. Overall, the study's results empirically demonstrate the important impacts that user-IS department exchange and perceived organizational support have on the business professional's intention to volunteer his/her IT competence to the firm.","['IT competence', 'social exchange theory', 'organizational citizenship behaviour', 'perceived organizational support', 'user-IS department exchange', 'IT human capital']",Joshua M Davis,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Davis%2C+Joshua+M,"Department of Marketing and Supply Chain ManagementSchool of Business, College of CharlestonCharlestonSCU.S.A.

In this paper, we study the role of online seller reviews and product price in buyers’ WTP. We offer a conceptual framework from a risk perspective in which we argue that the different effects of seller reviews and product price on buyers’ WTP may emerge simultaneously in an online market. We highlight two important drivers for such qualitatively different effects: a difference in buyers’ risk attitudes (averse, neutral, or seeking) and a difference in WTP measures (absolute or relative). We test our hypotheses and find good support for them both internally (an experimental study) and externally (an empirical study).

Typically, there have developed implicit or explicit assumptions that top management support has to be constant and consistent during the entire life of an IS implementation project. However, previous research investigating this issue has been based mainly on a ‘single project’ perspective, although contemporary organisational settings have increasingly involved many projects taking place simultaneously. Such multiple-project environments bring into question the feasibility of the previous assumptions and invite revisiting them. This paper aims to do this by examining the materialisation of top management support in a multiple-project environment. To this end, it investigates the interactions between a project to implement an Enterprise Resource Planning system and other projects and programmes in a prominent international organisation. It applies a framework from Actor Network Theory to explore the different aspects of what is involved in being in a multiple-project environment and the nature of the materialisation of top management support. The findings unravel some of the complexity surrounding top management support in this contemporary organisational setting. Some important implications for theory and practice are highlighted and discussed.","['IS project management', 'top management support', 'multiple projects', 'qualitative case study', 'Actor Network Theory']",Amany Elbanna,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Elbanna%2C+Amany,"Royal Holloway University of LondonSurreyU.K.

The current understanding of privacy is largely fragmented and discipline-dependent. This study develops and tests a framework of information privacy and its correlates, the latter often being confused with or built into definitions of information privacy per se. Our framework development was based on the privacy theories of Westin and Altman, the economic view of the privacy calculus, and the identity management framework of Zwick and Dholakia. The dependent variable of the model is perceived information privacy. The particularly relevant correlates to information privacy are anonymity, secrecy, confidentiality, and control. We posit that the first three are tactics for information control; perceived information control and perceived risk are salient determinants of perceived information privacy; and perceived risk is a function of perceived benefits of information disclosure, information sensitivity, importance of information transparency, and regulatory expectations. The research model was empirically tested and validated in the Web 2.0 context, using a survey of Web 2.0 users. Our study enhances the theoretical understanding of information privacy and is useful for privacy advocates, and legal, management information systems, marketing, and social science scholars.","['privacy', 'anonymity', 'secrecy', 'confidentiality', 'control', 'risk']",Paul Hart,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Hart%2C+Paul,,

While the vast majority of research papers on IS business value find empirical evidence in favour of both the operational and strategic relevance of IS, the fundamental question of the causal relationship between IS investments and business value remains partly unexplained. Three research tasks are essential requisites on the path towards addressing this epistemological question: the synthesis of existing knowledge, the identification of a lack of knowledge and the proposition of paths for closing the knowledge gaps. This paper considers each of these tasks. Research findings include that correlations between IS investments and productivity vary widely among companies and that the mismeasurement of IS investment impact may be rooted in delayed effects. Key limitations of current research are based on the ambiguity and fuzziness of IS business value, the neglected disaggregation of IS investments, and the unexplained process of creating internal and competitive value. Addressing the limitations we suggest research paths, such as the identification of synergy opportunities of IS assets, and the explanation of relationships between IS innovation and change in IS capabilities.","['IS business value', 'IS research framework', 'IS impact', 'IS value', 'research agenda', 'literature review']",Guido Schryen,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Schryen%2C+Guido,"Institute of Management Information Systems, University of RegensburgRegensburgGermany

We analyze the effect of time-inconsistent preferences of present-biased managers on the exercise time of real growth options and the realized value using a discrete time option valuation model. The results show that present-biased managers are more likely to exercise options early when the net payoffs are low, the option payoffs have high volatility, and the risk free discount rate is small. In addition, present biased managers are more likely to exercise a growth option early in its life when the project is performing well.

We analyze the effect of time-inconsistent preferences of present-biased managers on the exercise time of real growth options and the realized value using a discrete time option valuation model. The results show that present-biased managers are more likely to exercise options early when the net payoffs are low, the option payoffs have high volatility, and the risk free discount rate is small. In addition, present biased managers are more likely to exercise a growth option early in its life when the project is performing well.

Our findings suggest that under certain circumstances, perceived personalization quality can outweigh the impact of privacy concerns. This implies that service providers can improve the perceived quality of personalization services being offered in order to offset customer privacy concerns. Nevertheless, the impact of perceived quality on personalization usage is weaker for customers who have experienced privacy invasion in the past.

Survey data collected from 250 online auction participants were used to test the model using partial least squares analysis. SC and CE were found to have significant impacts on OB that were either partially or fully mediated by WCB.

To fill this gap, this paper critically examines and compares these core variables as well as their relationships with key technology acceptance determinants. We find that (1) BI has a much higher correlation with the determinants than does usage, and thus more variance in BI than in usage can be explained; (2) BI is not a good surrogate for usage; (3) among the three usage constructs, assessed usage is the most and actual usage is the least highly correlated with BI; and (4) researchers should examine both actual usage and assessed usage in their every single study to bring to light the true relationships between system usage and its antecedents. This study thus helps IS scholars expand their baseline knowledge of these core variables, interpret the important messages conveyed by the extant literature, and conduct more fruitful and illuminating future research on user behavior.","['actual usage', 'behavioral intention', 'meta-analysis', 'perceived ease of use', 'perceived usefulness', 'system usage']",Jiming Wu,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Wu%2C+Jiming,"Department of ManagementCollege of Business and Economics, California State UniversityEast BayU.S.A.

We find that (1) BI has a much higher correlation with the determinants than does usage, and thus more variance in BI than in usage can be explained; (2) BI is not a good surrogate for usage; (3) among the three usage constructs, assessed usage is the most and actual usage is the least highly correlated with BI; and (4) researchers should examine both actual usage and assessed usage in their every single study to bring to light the true relationships between system usage and its antecedents. This study thus helps IS scholars expand their baseline knowledge of these core variables, interpret the important messages conveyed by the extant literature, and conduct more fruitful and illuminating future research on user behavior.","['actual usage', 'behavioral intention', 'meta-analysis', 'perceived ease of use', 'perceived usefulness', 'system usage']",Hongwei Du,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Du%2C+Hongwei,"Department of ManagementCollege of Business and Economics, California State UniversityEast BayU.S.A.

The model was tested by measuring students’ perceptions, who participated in an experimental study that required them to use a GCP for collaboratively planning a trip. Students used Yahoo! Trip Planner (Y!TP) for forming groups and then for identifying, selecting and discussing the inclusion and scheduling of geo-referenced travel activities, places and itineraries on the top of a map. The findings confirmed the multidimensionality of the Y!TP's impact on collaborative decision making, but the respondents gave a greater importance to the process (i.e. effectiveness and community building) rather than the outcome impacts (efficiency and results) of Y!TP. Specifically, the findings show that GCP can effectively support and foster teamwork, when GCP are designed to scaffold the group tasks, manage group intelligence, as well as facilitate and nurture group communication and bonding processes. The outcome impacts of GCP related to both qualitative (e.g. group consensus) and quantitative items (e.g. time and effort savings). Finally, the study discusses the implications of the findings on further investigating the functionality and effectiveness of GCP.","['geocollaborative portals', 'GIS', 'web 2.0', 'collaboration', 'group decision making', 'impact', 'trip planning']",Marianna Sigala,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Sigala%2C+Marianna,"Department of Business AdministrationUniversity of the AegeanChiosGreece

This study examines the role of free comments given in a commercial information service through the lens of the expectation-confirmation theory and continuance. Data from a question and answer web site are analyzed by structural equations modeling to test the theoretical model whereby customer satisfaction is key to continuance and is predicted largely by social interaction that takes place on the site. The model is supported by the field data retrieved from the site. The data show that people came with equal expectations, received equal service, and continued to use the system if they were satisfied with it. Satisfaction was predicted by conversation. Free activity emerges as an integral part of the service in a fee-based information market, improving satisfaction and continuance, and thereby leading to measurable outcomes for the commercial owners of the site. The findings, based on unobtrusive field data rather than self-report questionnaires, extend expectation confirmation theory by adding a social dimension to it.","['information markets', 'incentives for participation', 'expectation-confirmation theory', 'satisfaction', 'continuance']",Raban Daphne Ruth,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Ruth%2C+Raban+Daphne,"University of HaifaHaifaIsrael

However, before adopting this technology, managers need to be able to identify its direct and indirect benefits. These benefits are expected to be significant and have begun to be studied empirically and analytically in narrow, isolated segments (e.g., supply chain management). In this paper, we focus on applications of RFID in the retail sector, specifically in store operations. We have adapted the balanced scorecard (BSC) model as a decision-making framework to build a holistic model of RFID-enabled changes throughout retail store operations including marketing, merchandising, and supply chain management. After reviewing the existing literature, we conducted a Delphi study in which 10 consultants and senior managers from leading U.S. retailers were interviewed. The results indicate that benefits in the areas of merchandising and marketing may not be realized as directly as those in the supply chain, but their effects should not be underestimated. The proposed BSC model can also indicate potential opportunities for item-level RFID use in retailing and serve as a guideline for further studies.","['item-level RFID', 'retailers', 'strategic decision making', 'balanced scorecard', 'Delphi method', 'operations management']",Narges Kasiri,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Kasiri%2C+Narges,"Division of Economics and Business, Marketing and Information Systems DepartmentSUNY Oneonta, ManagementOneontaNYU.S.A.

However, before adopting this technology, managers need to be able to identify its direct and indirect benefits. These benefits are expected to be significant and have begun to be studied empirically and analytically in narrow, isolated segments (e.g., supply chain management). In this paper, we focus on applications of RFID in the retail sector, specifically in store operations. We have adapted the balanced scorecard (BSC) model as a decision-making framework to build a holistic model of RFID-enabled changes throughout retail store operations including marketing, merchandising, and supply chain management. After reviewing the existing literature, we conducted a Delphi study in which 10 consultants and senior managers from leading U.S. retailers were interviewed. The results indicate that benefits in the areas of merchandising and marketing may not be realized as directly as those in the supply chain, but their effects should not be underestimated. The proposed BSC model can also indicate potential opportunities for item-level RFID use in retailing and serve as a guideline for further studies.","['item-level RFID', 'retailers', 'strategic decision making', 'balanced scorecard', 'Delphi method', 'operations management']",Ramesh Sharda,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Sharda%2C+Ramesh,"William S.

Although much excitement has surrounded the idea of virtual worlds, a gap exists between those who register and those who engage in virtual worlds. Our analysis of the gap between those who merely register to join a virtual world and those who ultimately engage the community on a regular basis derives from a lack of assimilation. We present the 3C approach, a high-level theoretical framework delineating the relationship between three classes of factors (namely the technology class of factors; the community class of factors; and the user class of factors) that we posit explain virtual world assimilation and employ theories to represent these classes of factors and the interaction between them. After discussing and integrating these three classes of factors, we test our model through a study of 223 new users of Second Life. The results provide empirical support for the 3C framework; specifically, our analysis indicates that the technology and community classes of factors in exert a direct influence upon a user's attitude towards the virtual world, and this relationship is moderated by the user class of factors.","['virtual worlds', 'IT adoption', 'IT assimilation', 'Second Life', 'structural equation modeling']",Andrew Schwarz,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Schwarz%2C+Andrew,"Louisiana State UniversityLAUSA

This is so despite the diversity of research methods available, the emergence of an interpretivist tradition, and some isolated examples of methodological pluralism. While there have been significant contributions in guiding qualitative research methods teaching, little research has been undertaken that considers the training actually provided, and the possible impacts this may have on the quality and quantity of qualitative research articles in our journals. This explorative study aims to provide some insight into what training is provided, the issues confronted, and possible impediments to publishing qualitative research. Data were collected from interviews with a panel of international colleagues who have a range of experience in teaching and applying qualitative methods.

This is so despite the diversity of research methods available, the emergence of an interpretivist tradition, and some isolated examples of methodological pluralism. While there have been significant contributions in guiding qualitative research methods teaching, little research has been undertaken that considers the training actually provided, and the possible impacts this may have on the quality and quantity of qualitative research articles in our journals. This explorative study aims to provide some insight into what training is provided, the issues confronted, and possible impediments to publishing qualitative research. Data were collected from interviews with a panel of international colleagues who have a range of experience in teaching and applying qualitative methods.

Besides critical research and sometimes positivism, qualitative research in information systems can be performed following a paradigm of pragmatism. This paradigm is associated with action, intervention and constructive knowledge. This paper has picked out interpretivism and pragmatism as two possible and important research paradigms for qualitative research in information systems. It clarifies each paradigm in an ideal-typical fashion and then conducts a comparison revealing commonalities and differences. It is stated that a qualitative researcher must either adopt an interpretive stance aiming towards an understanding that is appreciated for being interesting; or a pragmatist stance aiming for constructive knowledge that is appreciated for being useful in action. The possibilities of combining pragmatism and interpretivism in qualitative research in information systems are analysed. A research case (conducted through action research (AR) and design research (DR)) that combines interpretivism and pragmatism is used as an illustration. It is stated in the paper that pragmatism has influenced IS research to a fairly large extent, albeit in a rather implicit way. The paradigmatic foundations are seldom known and explicated. This paper contributes to a further clarification of pragmatism as an explicit research paradigm for qualitative research in information systems. Pragmatism is considered an appropriate paradigm for AR and DR.","['qualitative research', 'interpretivism', 'pragmatism', 'paradigm', 'information systems']",Göran Goldkuhl,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Goldkuhl%2C+G%C3%B6ran,"Linköping UniversityLinköpingSweden;Stockholm UniversityKistaSweden

However, insufficient attention has been spent on understanding the unique validity and reliability issues related to the timeline that is either explicitly or implicitly required in a longitudinal case study. In this paper, we address three forms of longitudinal timeline validity: time unit validity (which deals with the question of how to segment the timeline – weeks, months, years, etc.), time boundaries validity (which deals with the question of how long the timeline should be), and time period validity (which deals with the issue of which periods should be in the timeline). We also examine timeline reliability, which deals with the question of whether another judge would have assigned the same events to the same sequence, categories, and periods. Techniques to address these forms of longitudinal timeline validity include: matching the unit of time to the pace of change to address time unit validity, use of member checks and formal case study protocol to address time boundaries validity, analysis of archival data to address both time unit and time boundary validity, and the use of triangulation to address timeline reliability.

Various forms of qualitative analysis of the content of these data exist and have revealed important insights. Yet, to date, these analyses have been hampered by limitations of human coding of large data sets, and by bias due to human interpretation. In this paper, we compare and combine two quantitative analysis techniques to demonstrate the capabilities of computational analysis for content analysis of unstructured text.

While the integration of such opposing strategies requires software organizations to become ambidextrous, there is limited actionable advice on how managers can develop such capability. Against this backdrop, we report from a two-year action research study into a small software firm, TelSoft. Based on Pettigrew's contextualist inquiry, we develop a framework that integrates existing theory on contextual ambidexterity with a generic process for improving software organizations, and we apply this framework to analyze how TelSoft improved its coordination of products, projects, and innovation efforts. As a result, we offer principles for how software managers can build ambidextrous capability to improve firm-level coordination.","['software organization', 'contextual ambidexterity', 'firm-level coordination', 'action research']",Nannette P Napier,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Napier%2C+Nannette+P,"School of Science and Technology, Georgia Gwinnett CollegeLawrencevilleGAU.S.A.

Yet, this fact has not been integrated into existing analyses, and its implications have not been fully developed. We propose that IOIS scholars need to look beyond the single adopting organization in IOIS adoption studies and in contrast consider adoption units what we call an adoption configuration. Each such configuration can be further characterized along the following dimensions: (1) vision, (2) key functionality, (3) mode of interaction, (4) structure and (5) mode of appropriation. In addition, these dimensions do not co-vary independently. For example, a particular organizing vision assumes a specific inter-organizational structure. A typology of IOIS configurations for adoption analysis is laid out consisting of dyadic, hub and spoke, industry and community configurations.

With the advent of open-source and on-demand solutions, new models for developing and distributing software have entered the stage providing IS managers with more options in AS selection. On the basis of an Analytic Hierarchy Process model, we propose a framework including software package and implementation attributes on different hierarchy levels to examine how IS managers evaluate the relative fulfilment of key selection criteria by traditional, open-source, and on-demand office suites. By testing the framework with a random sample of 254 IS managers of 166 smaller and 88 mid-sized/larger firms, we validate its validity and usefulness in evaluating different software delivery models. Our empirical results show that open-source office suites were consistently perceived to be superior in meeting ease of customization (i.e., extensibility and adaptability) and cost criteria (i.e., acquisition and maintenance cost), whereas traditional software models were superior in fulfilling functionality, ease of use, and support requirements. On-demand office suites excelled in the fulfilment of time-to-value and data recoverability. We discuss further results of the comparison of the three software models, and derive practical and research implications for office suite selection.","['office suite selection', 'evaluation criteria', 'software models', 'open-source', 'on-demand', 'Analytic Hierarchy Process']",Alexander Benlian,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Benlian%2C+Alexander,"Institute for Information Systems and New Media, University of Munich, Munich School of Business Ludwigstr. 28 80539MunichGermany

IT organizations in both countries apply education and training as well as internal procedures to successfully deal with the problems of rapid IT change.

On the basis of visualization technologies and on knowledge modeling techniques, knowledge maps (Kmaps) help represent the knowledge assets of a company as graphical discrete objects.

Using a case study of three firms’ use of Kmaps in their Human Resource departments and drawing upon Bourdieu's social theory, illusion of control theory, and IS as signal and symbol theory, our study provides a critical perspective on the use of Kmaps by groups of actors to reinforce their social domination in business organizations. We find that Kmap use can lead to illusions of knowledge control and illusions of executive control and that in response to the potential for knowledge illusions, three social domination strategies – a signal and symbol strategy, an avoidance strategy and an evidence strategy – are employed.

Interpretational confounding, the disparity in the nominal and empirical meaning of a formatively measured construct, is at the center stage of the concern. Our study examines the issue in the context of the higher-order abstraction, focusing on the formatively defined relationship between the second-order construct and its indicators (i.e., first-order latent variables). Although the second-order formative abstraction is a widely accepted practice in structural equation modeling, the estimation results have been given a blind faith with no attempt to evaluate their integrity. Our empirical test, therefore, constitutes an attempt to fill the void. This study observed moderations of the theoretical relationship between reflectively designed first-order constructs and formatively defined second-order constructs when there is a change of endogenous variables. For this, two different formatively defined second-order constructs (i.e., IT management capabilities and IT personnel expertise) are utilized for the empirical testing. The estimation reveals that, while there was a considerable moderation of weights between IT management capabilities and its first-order constructs, those between IT personnel expertise and its first-order constructs remained relatively stable. These results demonstrate that the formatively defined relationship between the first- and second-order constructs can be precarious depending on the choice of the dependent variables. The analysis, therefore, revealed a significant presence of interpretational confounding and a higher chance of Type 1 error in model estimation. This implies that it becomes difficult to retain the construct validity and external validity of a formatively defined second-order construct. Thus, researchers are encouraged to exercise caution in mobilizing the formatively defined second-order measurement.","['structural equation modeling', 'formative measurement', 'formative indicator', 'second-order construct', 'interpretational confounding', 'construct validity']",Bongsik Shin,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Shin%2C+Bongsik,"Information and Decision Systems, San Diego State UniversityU.S.A.

This perspective allows us to capture the legacy of scientific writing standards, which emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries. Then, we focus on two leading IS journals (EJIS and MISQ). An historical analysis of both outlets is carried out, based on data related to their creation, evolution of editorial statements, and key epistemological and methodological aspects. We also focus on argumentative strategies found in a sample of 436 abstracts from both journals. Three main logical anchorages (sometimes combined) are identified, and related to three argumentative strategies: ‘deepening of knowledge’, ‘solving an enigma’ and ‘addressing a practical managerial issue’. We relate these writing norms to historical imprints of management and business studies, in particular: enigma-focused rhetorics, interest in institutionalized literature, neglect for managerially grounded rhetoric and lack of reflexivity in scientific writing. We explain this relation as a quest for academic legitimacy. Lastly, some suggestions are offered to address the discrepancies between these writing norms and more recent epistemological and theoretical stances adopted by IS researchers.","['argumentative strategies', 'history', 'academic writing', 'legitimacy']",Michael D Myers,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Myers%2C+Michael+D,View further author information,

While some research methods are closely related to the positivist research paradigm (experiments, surveys, and structural equation modelling) and others to the interpretivist paradigm (field study, ethnography, and action research), the critical paradigm is not identified with specific ‘critical methods’ and typically relies on the appropriation of interpretivist methods (such as critical ethnography). The criticism of the critical research paradigm in IS has often focused on the lack of distinctly critical research methods and even the neglect of methodological issues (Klein; McGrath). This paper questions the notion of and the arguments behind the quest for ‘critical research methods’ defined in contrast to positivist and interpretivist methods. Instead, the paper argues that it is a critical research methodology – understood as an overall strategy of conceptualizing and conducting an inquiry, engaging with studied phenomena, and constructing and justifying socially relevant knowledge, which distinguishes critical from other research paradigms. Building on a Kleinian argument regarding the need for common principles across diverse critical IS inquiries (Klein; Myers & Klein) this paper proposes a framework that describes key dimensions of a critical research methodology that distinguish critical from other research paradigms and provide methodological guidance in the doing of critical research.","['IS research paradigms', 'critical IS research', 'critical concerns in information systems', 'critical research methodology']",Dubravka Cecez-Kecmanovic,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Cecez-Kecmanovic%2C+Dubravka,"School of Information Systems, Technology and Management, Australian School of Business, University of New South WalesAustralia

Foucauldian and Toulminian insights,Issue 4,"Volume 20, 2011 - Issue 4: Including a Special Section on Kleinian Approach to Information Systems Research","Following the Kleinian spirit, this study takes a critical view of the existing orthodoxy within information systems (IS) and reframes the ongoing discussion concerning the intellectual core, identity and disciplinary status of IS using the disciplinary analysis of Michel Foucault and Stephen Toulmin. Instead of limiting the discussion to specific paradigms, topics, subjects or content, it focuses on the characteristics, rules and goals of IS as an academic field. A disciplinary lens is used to frame what it means to be a field, discipline and science, and in the process the study uncovers four doxas that have shaped the development of the IS field: (1) the IS research community sees no difference between fields, disciplines or sciences; (2) IT changes so rapidly, and thus the IS field needs to change to remain relevant; (3) disciplines are by definition rigid, inflexible and uni-theoretical and (4) because IS is pluralistic, IS should not become a discipline. This study's analyses of the IS field's discursive formation and intellectual ideals offer novel perspectives that allow for the integration of the IS field's plurality and diversity. To transform the IS field from its multimodal existence into a vibrant, diverse, academically and socially relevant and influential discipline, the study proposes actionable strategies that include (1) agreeing on the intellectual ideals for IS, (2) focusing on conceptual formation, (3) focusing on theory construction, (4) erecting genealogical boundaries and (5) fostering the development of professional bodies.","['philosophy of science', 'information systems (IS) disciplinarity', 'IS theory', 'disciplinary theory', 'archaeology of knowledge', 'intellectual structure']",Nik R Hassan,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Hassan%2C+Nik+R,"University of Minnesota DuluthDuluthU.S.A.

Successful t-government is predicated on citizen adoption and usage of e-government services. The contribution of this research is to enhance our understanding of the factors associated with the usage of e-government services among members of a community on the unfortunate side of the divide.

To answer these questions, a field survey was conducted within the international financial services industry. The results provide evidence that the implementation of an EAM function is in fact supportive in the creation and sustainment of IT efficiency and IT flexibility.

We employed a multi-case study method in this exploratory research with the objectives of defining individual level ERP assimilation and identifying key influential factors. Interviews with ERP users at all levels in five organizations revealed four key drivers: influence of supervisors, performance evaluation schemes, intrinsic motivation, and perceived usefulness, as well as two significant moderators: job specifications and individual absorptive capacity. Moreover, evidence suggests a potential relationship between individual level and organizational level ERP assimilations. Our findings highlight the importance of individual level assimilation within a firm in the post-implementation phase and provide managerial insights on how firms could improve ERP assimilation at the individual level that could impact the organizational level assimilation.","['enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'individual level assimilation', 'organizational level assimilation', 'multi-case study']",Luning Liu,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Liu%2C+Luning,"Management Science and Engineering, School of Management, Harbin Institute of TechnologyHarbinChina

This paper seeks to address this shortcoming by presenting a theory-grounded framework for exploring these factors and explaining their influence on OSS adoption, with the context of study being small- to medium-sized Information Technology (IT) businesses in the U.K. The framework has implications for this type of business – and, we will suggest, more widely – as a frame of reference for understanding, and as tool for evaluating benefits and challenges in, OSS adoption.

Toward greater integration of insights from reductionistic and holistic approaches,Issue 1,"Volume 20, 2011 - Issue 1","After more than two decades of intensive research, researchers are still struggling to explain the strategic value of information technology (IT) capabilities. The current study suggests that sufficient advancement has not been made in this area of research because of the gap between the richness of theoretical formulations and the minimalism of the reductionistic approach taken to test them. While theoretical formulations describe complex relationships between IT capabilities and competitive advantage, reductionistic explanations rely on models that represent the integration of simple relationships. This area of research can, therefore, benefit from the wider adoption of a holistic approach that attributes competitive advantage to profiles of IT capabilities. This study draws on the resource-based view and configurational theory to develop two reductionistic (direct and mediation) and two holistic (gestalt and profile-deviation) models of IT strategic value. The four models are tested with data collected from IT managers. The empirical analysis illustrates the insights that can be gained by drawing on the relative strengths of reductionistic and holistic explanations of IT strategic value.","['IT strategic value', 'IT capabilities', 'competitive advantage', 'resource-based view', 'configurational theory']",Lior Fink,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Fink%2C+Lior,"Ben-Gurion University of the NegevBeer-ShevaIsrael

A key gap in the literature is lack of recognition that underlying this macro level of alignment are other, more granular levels of alignment involving the interdependent subunits within the corporate IT unit. Given the critical interdependencies between development and testing subunits in software engineering, this paper focuses on an alignment model for ensuring that these two functions work together effectively. A development-testing alignment (DTA) model is described, and a case study investigating its value and application is presented. This DTA is decomposed into distinct components for the purposes of theoretical clarity and pragmatic application. The case study analysis uses the model to understand and interpret development-testing alignment in a Fortune 500 company. We found that the development and testing functions were significantly misaligned, and our model identified close to twenty specific aspects that needed to be considered to enhance alignment. These included changes in specificity of scope, governance, resource availability, competencies, and processes. Our analysis shows that the DTA model can be usefully applied for the purpose of understanding tactical alignment between subunits within a corporate IT unit. It also demonstrates that there is value in considering alignment as a dynamic, context-driven, social phenomenon as well as a useful interpretative lens for exploring organizational interactions and interdependencies.","['software development', 'software testing', 'strategic alignment', 'case study']",Colin Onita,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Onita%2C+Colin,"University of MemphisTennesseeU.S.A.

It also demonstrates that there is value in considering alignment as a dynamic, context-driven, social phenomenon as well as a useful interpretative lens for exploring organizational interactions and interdependencies.","['software development', 'software testing', 'strategic alignment', 'case study']",Jasbir Dhaliwal,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Dhaliwal%2C+Jasbir,"University of MemphisTennesseeU.S.A.

Data from 308 end-users were analyzed to evaluate the relationships between system use and technology enabled job learning, and technology enabled job learning and technology outcomes. Technology enabled job learning was conceptualized in terms of how computer applications helped individuals learn and better perform their jobs. System use was conceptualized in terms of decision support, work integration, and customer service. Technology outcomes were conceptualized in terms of management control, task innovation, task productivity, and customer satisfaction. Results suggest that systems use has a significant, positive effect on job learning, and that job learning has a significant, positive effect on technology outcomes.

This paper examines the quality of the online service provided by the Irish Revenue Commissioners’ tax filing and collection system, Revenue Online Service (ROS). A modified version of the recently operationalized E-S-QUAL instrument is used to examine online service quality from the point of view of the citizens and tax practitioners who use this eGovernment system. The findings show that efficiency and ease of completion are the dimensions of website service quality that most influence ROS users’ perceptions of value and convenience as well as their intentions to use and recommend the website to their peers. The practical implications of these findings include the fact that providers of public sector e-services should concentrate on communicating the functionality of their e-services. In addition, they should focus on reducing citizen concerns regarding misuse or mismanagement of personal data.","['e-government', 'service quality', 'online taxation', 'E-S-QUAL', 'E-PUBLIC-SECTOR-QUAL']",Aideen Kearney,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Kearney%2C+Aideen,"Department of StatisticsTrinity CollegeIreland

Little research has been done on the way individual and group resistance emerges and evolves during prior stages of projects. This focus on pre-implementation phases is important since Information Systems (IS) managers need to anticipate potential conflicts and users’ resistance that can involve project failure. While IS literature has separately developed theories on resistance and conflicts, we conceptualise a whole theoretic-system we call ‘IT Conflict-Resistance Theory’ (IT-CRT). This theory is used as driver for a 2-year action research project conducted at Netia Corporation (a worldwide leader in video and audio broadcasting) during preliminary phases of its Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) implementation project. According to our findings, while conflicts toward IT implementation are often considered to have negative effects and require being actively managed by top managers, the case study delivers an alternative observation: a passive-like attitude of managers during the IT pre-implantation phase does not prevent the resolution of a socio-political oriented conflict between two groups of employees. Our observations illustrate how the avoidance management style invites team members to cope with conflict situations and to express tacit causes of resistance. While most Management Information System methods tend naturally to maximise users’ satisfaction and to reduce potential resistance, the IT-CRT theory developed in this article supports an alternative approach: enhancing resistance in order to anticipate and resolve latent conflicts that are directly or indirectly related to the project. The underlying message of this article for researchers and practitioners is to consider users’ resistance toward IT as a key process embedded into IT choices and IS design.","['resistance', 'conflicts', 'avoidance', 'pre-implementation', 'ERP']",Régis Meissonier,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Meissonier%2C+R%C3%A9gis,"CREGOR, Montpellier II UniversityFrance

In addition, our field study indicates that technologies available in museums – namely audio guides, interactive kiosks and computers – contribute positively to an experience of the past.","['museum technologies', 'IS evaluation', 'user experience', 'phenomenology', 'post-phenomenology', 'multi-methodology']",Emmanuel Monod,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Monod%2C+Emmanuel,"CREPA, Université Paris DauphineFrance

We used structural equation modelling to empirically test these relationships. The findings showed that adopting IBIS indirectly improves the operational performance of firms through business process performance. The positive effect on financial performance of adopting IBIS is not direct, but through the mediating effects of operational performance and business process performance. We also utilised multiple group analysis to test some of the model relationships across firms using several organisational and environmental factors as moderators. The organisational factors tested are firm type, age and ownership type. The environmental factors consisted of dynamism, complexity and hostility. We found that the organisational factors are significant moderators and that complexity and hostility are not significant moderators. However, the effects of dynamism as a moderator are less clear.","['information technology', 'interorganisational systems', 'supply chain management', 'Internet', 'e-commerce', 'survey']",Ismail Sila,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Sila%2C+Ismail,"Department of Finance and Management ScienceEdwards School of Business, University of SaskatchewanSaskatoonCanada

A test of two competing hypotheses of IT innovation and environment alignment,Issue 5,"Volume 19, 2010 - Issue 5","When does it benefit a firm to take a lead in innovation with information technology (IT)? How should a firm align its IT innovation with a dynamic industry?

The traditional ‘fit’ perspective predicts that a firm that matches its IT innovation with a dynamic environment would obtain performance benefits. In contrast, the ‘options’ perspective suggests that a firm that takes advantage of a stable environment to proactively pursue IT innovation and develop IT capability as real options would obtain performance advantage. We employ a quasi-experiment design to test these two competing hypotheses using archival data of IT leaders over a time frame of 6 years. We perform a longitudinal analysis of the performance change trajectories of proactive and reactive IT leaders over time. The results indicate a general support for the ‘options’ perspective that proactive IT leaders that lead in innovation with IT in relatively stable environments are found to consistently outperform reactive IT leaders in overall performance, allocative efficiency, and cost efficiency in management process. However, interestingly, the results also show a partial support for the ‘fit’ perspective that reactive IT leaders that emphasize intensive deployment of IT innovation in dynamic environments are found to obtain a cost advantage in production and operation process over time. The findings offer practical implications for managers to better engage in IT innovations to create and sustain competitive advantage. Synthesizing options thinking and dynamic capability perspective, we provide a framework to better understand IT innovation, dynamic environment, and performance outcomes.

The result is a pluralistic discipline that has triggered an ongoing debate about whether the ‘liquidity’ characteristic of IS is a natural consequence of rapidly changing technologies or if it is indicative of a chaotic state that is unsustainable. This paper looks at IS through a new and different lens by using the theory of the professions to gain insight into current and heretofore unidentified problems facing the discipline. Casting IS as a profession presents an integrated view of academic IS, IS practice and IS education grounded in a framework that explores connections among these three elements.

To demonstrate the utility of this perspective, we deliberately consider a ‘strange’ case from a different time, space and culture. We discuss the nature of human organisation among the Inka Empire and how this organisation was reliant upon the enactment of significance, particularly in relation to an artefact known as the khipu.

This paper draws on research in a number of disciplines as well as a study of eight electronic marketplaces to build a theory of electronic marketplace performance. In doing so, we identify key performance measures for electronic marketplaces as well as the strategic, structural and contextual factors that impact performance. We identify how these factors can be observed, and illustrate how the fit between strategic and contextual factors affects performance.

This paper draws on research in a number of disciplines as well as a study of eight electronic marketplaces to build a theory of electronic marketplace performance. In doing so, we identify key performance measures for electronic marketplaces as well as the strategic, structural and contextual factors that impact performance. We identify how these factors can be observed, and illustrate how the fit between strategic and contextual factors affects performance. We present our theory as hypotheses and provide the empirical indicators for the constituent constructs.","['electronic marketplace', 'performance', 'model']",Patrick Finnegan,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Finnegan%2C+Patrick,"The Australian School of Business, University of New South WalesSydneyAustralia

A study of shopbotsâ€™ vendor coverage strategy,Issue 3,"Volume 19, 2010 - Issue 3","Consumers often use shopbots to search for information when making purchase decisions in Internet markets. Although they have varying sensitivity to shopbot bias, consumers generally prefer accurate market representation. However, in choosing the accuracy of market representation, shopbots must balance the desires of consumers with the costs of providing their services and with the desires of the vendors, who are often the largest source of their revenue. In this paper, we study how accurately shopbots represent a market and analyze the strategies shopbots adopt to achieve market representativeness. We theoretically identify two important drivers in shopbot vendor coverage strategy – how many vendors it covers (shopbot size) and which vendors it covers (shopbot affiliation) – and analytically show how the drivers affect shopbot market representativeness. We report the results of a large-scale study in which we collected 2.2 million vendor price listings from eight shopbots and develop metrics for measuring shopbot size, shopbot affiliation, and shopbot market representativeness. We found that (1) shopbots do not represent markets equally well; (2) size drives a shopbot's market representativeness positively whereas affiliation drives a shopbot's market representativeness negatively; (3) shopbots follow differnet vendor representative strategies to pursue market representativeness.","['electronic markets', 'shopbots', 'market representativeness', 'vendor coverage strategy']",Gove Allen,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Allen%2C+Gove,"Brigham Young UniversityU.S.A.

This represents a case of extreme information systems development (ISD) failure en masse, where all but two of the 22 projects in a business unit went over budget, causing senior executives to refocus their strategic priorities and cancel all current and potential projects that followed. This study focuses specifically on the two best performing (12 and 4% under budget) and worst performing (223 and 320% over budget) of these projects. Using a framework drawn from control systems theory, this study examines the ‘tightness’ of budgetary control exerted over each project, and what was done or could have been done to avert such failure. The study then identifies a set of emerging factors affecting tight budgetary control in ISD.","['budgeting', 'system development', 'control', 'project management']",Kieran Conboy,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Conboy%2C+Kieran,"Centre for Innovation & Structural Change, NUI GalwayGalwayIreland

Despite agreement on its importance to an organization's success, the concept is still fuzzy and vague, and there is little consensus regarding its compositional facets. Identifying the fundamental concepts, modeling principles, practical functions, and reach of the BM relevant to IS and other business concepts is by no means complete. This paper, following a comprehensive review of the literature, principally employs the content analysis method and utilizes a deductive reasoning approach to provide a hierarchical taxonomy of the BM concepts from which to develop a more comprehensive framework. This framework comprises four fundamental aspects. First, it identifies four primary BM dimensions along with their constituent elements forming a complete ontological structure of the concept. Second, it cohesively organizes the BM modeling principles, that is, guidelines and features. Third, it explains the reach of the concept showing its interactions and intersections with strategy, business processes, and IS so as to place the BM within the world of digital business. Finally, the framework explores three major functions of BMs within digital organizations to shed light on the practical significance of the concept. Hence, this paper links the BM facets in a novel manner offering an intact definition. In doing so, this paper provides a unified conceptual framework for the BM concept that we argue is comprehensive and appropriate to the complex nature of businesses today. This leads to fruitful implications for theory and practice and also enables us to suggest a research agenda using our conceptual framework.","['business model', 'conceptual framework', 'content analysis', 'taxonomy', 'information systems']",Youngjin Yoo,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Yoo%2C+Youngjin,,

While prior research has examined the factors that lead to continued usage behavior, little knowledge has been established as to what extent characteristics of the users of process modeling grammars inform usage behavior. In this study, a theoretical model is advanced that incorporates determinants of continued usage behavior as well as key antecedent individual difference factors of the grammar users, such as modeling experience, modeling background and perceived grammar familiarity. Findings from a global survey of 529 grammar users support the hypothesized relationships of the model. The study offers three central contributions. First, it provides a validated theoretical model of post-adoptive modeling grammar usage intentions. Second, it discusses the effects of individual difference factors of grammar users in the context of modeling grammar usage.

A particularly important aspect is the challenging task of evaluating the multi-faceted benefits of RFID deployments. While a large body of research on RFID benefits exists, our literature review indicates the absence of a comprehensive approach. We introduce a framework that combines the benefit evaluation steps of identification, forecasting and assessment. Based on insights gained in a 3-year research project with case studies in logistics, we refine a process-based IT-benefits classification and subsequently derive six types of RFID benefits that support the systematic identification of benefits, as well as the selection of forecast and assessment methods. We discuss how our framework can facilitate and enhance RFID investment decisions and guide future research activities.","['RFID', 'cost–benefit analysis', 'logistics']",Jens Strüker,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Str%C3%BCker%2C+Jens,,

First, we describe an innovative large-scale trial that goes beyond what was done in earlier projects in several respects. The most fundamental difference from previous trials is the full integration of RFID event data with point-of-sale (POS) and master data, which for the first time offers the retailer the opportunity to directly observe and analyse physical in-store processes. Second, the heterogeneity of RFID applications implemented by Kaufhof allows us to theorise about the effects that RFID may have on business processes from an IT value perspective. We develop a conceptual model to explain the different cause-and-effect chains between RFID investments and their impact on firm performance, the role of complementary and contextual factors, and the difficulty of assessing these impacts using objective performance measures. Third, we compare the case to a prior trial conducted by Kaufhof about 5 years earlier.

To identify these differences, we suggest an analytical distinction between boundary factors and contextual contingencies, which can be used in a design and reconfiguration process.

Much of the research on gender and IT assumes a unilateral effect: all organizational factors affect all women in the same ways. An alternative view that is explored in this research is that within-gender differences offer rich insights into the gender imbalance in the IT profession. The individual differences theory of gender and IT enabled us to examine variation in organizational influences on women through analysis of transcripts from in-depth interviews conducted with 92 women in the IT workforce in the U.S.A. The results show that three organizational factors – work–life balance, organizational climate, and mentoring – affected the women's career development in a range of ways. Our findings shed new light on what has been interpreted by other researchers as contradictory findings because our theoretical starting point is the assumption that women are not all the same, that within-gender variation is expected and that it provides an opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of gender relations in the IT field. Using this theory we were able to identify opportunities for the development of interventions by linking the themes embedded in the three workplace factors to the constructs of the theory. The individual identity construct revealed the ways in which a woman's demographic and professional characteristics affect her career choices. The individual influences construct focused attention on the ways in which differences in personality, abilities, and influential people shape one's career.

As it is intractable to directly study the performance of strategies on real projects, we conducted a comprehensive empirically based simulation under a variety of conditions of requirements dynamism, project size, and duration. Simulation results suggest that a mixed strategy for requirements prioritization seems to work best in all but cost for typical levels of dynamism on average. Our findings also indicate that, as theorized, PB and agile strategies perform well within opposite extremes of dynamism. However, they do not outperform the mixed strategies even within their home grounds – that is large and complex systems with stable requirements for PB, and small and dynamic projects for agile methods. Given the unknown, unknowable, or variable nature of dynamism and the dramatic differences in effectiveness for agile and PB strategies under extreme development scenarios, a mixed strategy appears to yield the best results overall. We introduce two mixed strategies – simply adding cost–benefit (CB) to the agile approach, and a more sophisticated ‘hybrid’ (HY) approach that modulates development iteration size to maximize the expected CB for each iteration. We propose a step-by-step method to implement this HY strategy. We provide a structured analysis of the benefits and assumptions of agile and PB requirements prioritization methods (e.g., Pareto optimization), and outline a framework for analyzing and assessing the effectiveness of strategies including several new metrics. This research can furthermore serve as a framework for future validation of the proposed mixed strategies using actual software projects.","['requirements prioritization', 'agile prioritization', 'requirements engineering', 'strategic and development planning', 'integration of plan-based and flexible/agile processes', 'risk management']",Daniel Port,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Port%2C+Daniel,"Department of Information Technology ManagementShidler College of Business, University of HawaiiManoaU.S.A.

Unfortunately, there is a lack of research on the impact that the object of an outsourcing decision may have on the factors considered when making such a decision. The impact of organizational size and the firm's strategy has also not been conclusively established in the literature. This paper examines and compares the different supplier, internal, technology and cost factors considered when outsourcing Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) or Decision Support Systems (DSSs) (the object of a decision). It also examines the divergent decision factors for large, medium and small organizations, and the competitive strategy's impact on the factors that are considered. The paper is based on a study with samples from four large SAP Conferences and includes 1889 individuals working in organizations that use enterprise resource planning software. This research found that the object being outsourced, the firm's competitive strategies, and the organizational size are factors that significantly influence the outsourcing decision process. We found that the relative importance of decision factors for the outsourcing of OLTP is significantly different from those for a DSS and that, where the outsourcing object is of strategic importance, there is a closer attention to internal factors. Our findings confirm that outsourcing strategies are aligned with organizational strategies. For example, cost factors dominate in the outsourcing decision among organizations that employ a low-costs strategy as compared to those following a differentiation or niche strategy. Also, compared to firms pursuing other competitive strategies, for the outsourcing of DSS, differentiators place a significantly higher emphasis on supplier factors. Regarding the role of company size, we found significant differences in the importance given to supplier, internal, technology, and cost factors by organizations of different sizes. For example, compared to smaller organizations, larger organizations gave less importance to supplier and technology factors and more importance to cost factors.","['Information Systems', 'outsourcing', 'management']",Bjarne Berg,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Berg%2C+Bjarne,"Department of Business Information Systems & Operations ManagementThe Belk College of Business Administration, University of North Carolina at CharlotteCharlotteNCU.S.A.

A sequential mixed-methodological analysis, involving the use of qualitative and quantitative data analysis, was used to develop the classification.

The drivers identified were: changing business requirements, evolving internet strategies, addressing user needs, maintenance, changing technology, pressure from peers/competitors, and the influence of developers. However, only the first four were found to be significant in the study. The categorisation and the findings suggest a number of key determinants not explicitly addressed by other work. In addition, the findings provide little support for the staged approach to e-commerce progression as few companies reported the implementation of sophisticated internet technology features as a main reason for their web site redesigns. The contributions of this paper are firstly, to provide an instrument to the academic and practitioner communities interested in the topic of web site evolution. Secondly, the categorisation of drivers for redesign and the individual reasons found in this study are expected to provide assistance to SME managers to justify, plan and strategise internet investments realistically and effectively.","['web site redesign', 'Stage Models', 'SMEs', 'change framework', 'eCommerce', 'internet investment']",Robert Willison,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Willison%2C+Robert,View further author information,

In an attempt to fill this research gap, this study employs a socio-cognitive perspective, namely the concept of frames analysis, to investigate how the managers and employees of a financial institution make sense of IS security certification, BS 7799 Part 2, and how these interpretations influence their actions. Using an interpretive case study approach, the findings show that the expectations of management have a strong impact on the implementation of the certification process. Moreover, the incongruence between the perceptions of managers and those of the certification team and other employees means that IS security management concepts may not be fully embedded in the organization's work practices and routines. This article argues that during the certification process, managers should place more emphasis on the identification of frame incongruence and undertake early intervention to align frames in order to achieve overall security effectiveness in the organization.","['IS security', 'technological frames', 'IS security standard', 'security certification', 'interpretive research', 'institutionalization']",Carol W Hsu,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Hsu%2C+Carol+W,"Department of Information ManagementNational Taiwan UniversityTaiwan

Vendor support was a key facilitator of the anti-malware adoption for IS experts and IT intensive industry groups, while IT budget was for non-IS expert and non-IT intensive industry groups. Key implications for theory and practice are discussed.","['protection motivation', 'anti-malware', 'technology acceptance', 'partial least squares']",Richard Baskerville Editor-in-Chief,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Baskerville%2C+Richard+Editor-in-Chief,,

Unfortunately, implementing these large-scale systems is a complex and risky endeavor. As a result, these initiatives must tap the expertise and active involvement of both the IS department and the enterprise's functional areas. Past studies focusing on IS implementation teams consistently identify the IS department as the source of technical expertise and leadership, while functional department team members are typically relegated to the role of business experts. However, unlike the past, many business professionals are knowledgeable about information technology (IT) and are increasingly capable of contributing to IS implementations from a technical perspective as well as a business perspective. This study examines how IT competence held by both the IS department and the user department stakeholders contributes to user satisfaction with the enterprise-level system implementation. Specifically, this research introduces a theoretically grounded construct, joint IT competence, which emerges when the IS department and user department stakeholders integrate their individually held IT competences. The study's results empirically demonstrate that joint IT competence is a key driver of user satisfaction in enterprise-level IS implementations.

An Appendix summarizes previously published concepts and two frameworks that flow from the proposed definition and are useful for appreciating many points in the evaluation section.","['information system', 'work system', 'definition of information system', 'IS discipline', 'IT antifact']",Robert Winter,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Winter%2C+Robert,"Institute of Information Management, University of St. Gallen Mueller-Friedberg-Strasse 8, 9000 St GallenSwitzerland",

The motivations of the two partners appeared complementary – the computer scientists needed a hard problem to solve to focus their research, and the earth scientists had a hard problem in need of solution. This study uses theory and research on design from the social sciences to explore the experience of users who are included as partners in a design project. It finds that it is very difficult for a client partner to enter the ‘design world’ as full collaborators.","['design theory', 'design practice', 'scientific collaboration', 'design science research', 'designer-client colloboration']",Judith Weedman,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Weedman%2C+Judith,"School of Library and Information Science, San Jose State University 800 N.

The RAE is held at irregular intervals of time, the latest being held in 2008 (RAE 2008). The motivation is accountability of government spending, but in fact many different objectives are ascribed to the exercise. RAE 2008 is fully described so that it can be used to raise debating issues around the general issue of research quality, a subject that appears to be of universal interest in Information Systems.

While there are many theoretical prescriptions as to how the planned benefits from an information technology (IT) project might best be realized, there is very little empirical evidence, as to whether such advice is being heeded in practice. Drawing on the resource-based view of the firm, a conceptual model of a benefits realization capability is presented and developed. In this model, the benefits realization capability is operationalized through four distinct competences, each of which is underpinned by a variety of socially defined practices. The model was populated by using a thorough review of the literature to identify and categorize those specific practices that have the potential to contribute to the effective achievement of benefits from IT investment projects. These practices are then studied in an empirical examination of 25 IT projects. The analysis finds no evidence of benefits realization practices being adopted in any consistent, comprehensive or coherent manner. Effective benefits realization requires an ongoing commitment to, and focus upon, the benefits, rather than the technology, throughout a system's development, implementation and operation.","['IT benefits realization', 'organizational change', 'resource-based view', 'practices', 'systems development']",Joe Peppard,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Peppard%2C+Joe,"Information Systems Research Centre, Cranfield School of ManagementCranfieldBedfordU.K.

Then, beginning in 2000 and 2001, enrollments declined precipitously. This paper looks at the enrollment bubble and the dotcom bubble that drove IT enrollments. Although the enrollment bubble occurred worldwide, this paper focuses primarily on U.S. data, which is widely available, and secondarily on Western Europe data. The paper notes that the dotcom bubble was an investment disaster but that U.S. IT employment fell surprisingly little and soon surpassed the bubble's peak IT employment. In addition, U.S. IT unemployment rose to almost the level of total unemployment in 2003, then fell to traditional low levels by 2005. Job prospects in the U.S. and most other countries are good for the short term, and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics employment projections for 2006–2016 indicate that job prospects in the U.S. will continue to be good for most IT jobs. However, offshoring is a persistent concern for students in Western Europe and the United States. The data on offshoring are of poor quality, but several studies indicate that IT job losses from offshoring are small and may be counterbalanced by gains in IT inshoring jobs. At the same time, offshoring and productivity gains appear to be making low-level jobs such as programming and user support less attractive. This means that IS and computer science programs will have to focus on producing higher-level job skills among graduates. In addition, students may have to stop considering the undergraduate degree to be a terminal degree in IS and computer science.","['dotcom bubble', 'employment', 'inshoring', 'offshoring', 'outsourcing', 'unemployment']",Raymond R Panko,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Panko%2C+Raymond+R,"Shidler College of Business, University of HawaiiHonoluluHIU.S.A.

Through such planning, they attempt to align their IS strategy and their business strategy. This study tested the impact of business and information technology (IT) change on strategic information systems planning (SISP) horizon, of horizon on the planning itself, and of the planning on the alignment of IS strategy and business strategy. A questionnaire defined business change, IT change, and alignment as multi-item scaled questions, and planning horizon as a single, nonscaled one. It defined a multi-item scaled SISP measure as both a second-order construct and as single-order constructs for its individual phases. A postal survey collected data from 161 IS executives. Constructs were extensively validated. The analysis used structural equation modeling, and surprisingly found that business change predicted longer SISP horizons, but IT change predicted neither longer nor shorter ones. Planning horizon predicted SISP itself (as a second-order construct and as all of its phases), and such planning (as a second-order construct, and as strategic awareness and strategy conception phases) predicted alignment of IS strategy and business strategy. These findings suggest that practitioners more carefully assess their own degree of caution in setting planning horizons in response to business and IT change. In fact, the findings suggest it may not be necessary for practitioners to shorten planning horizons in a rapidly changing environment.","['strategic information systems planning', 'business change', 'information technology change', 'planning horizon', 'alignment of business strategy and information systems strategy']",Henry E Newkirk,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Newkirk%2C+Henry+E,"Department of Management Information SystemsCollege of Business, East Carolina UniversityGreenvilleNCU.S.A.

This study tested the impact of business and information technology (IT) change on strategic information systems planning (SISP) horizon, of horizon on the planning itself, and of the planning on the alignment of IS strategy and business strategy. A questionnaire defined business change, IT change, and alignment as multi-item scaled questions, and planning horizon as a single, nonscaled one. It defined a multi-item scaled SISP measure as both a second-order construct and as single-order constructs for its individual phases. A postal survey collected data from 161 IS executives. Constructs were extensively validated. The analysis used structural equation modeling, and surprisingly found that business change predicted longer SISP horizons, but IT change predicted neither longer nor shorter ones. Planning horizon predicted SISP itself (as a second-order construct and as all of its phases), and such planning (as a second-order construct, and as strategic awareness and strategy conception phases) predicted alignment of IS strategy and business strategy. These findings suggest that practitioners more carefully assess their own degree of caution in setting planning horizons in response to business and IT change.

While the key users did not use the system as intended and the project goals were not achieved, the project committee reported success to the top management board. Using a multi-methodological approach, we can follow how different stakeholders attributed different meanings to the system introduced over time. The rhetorical tools used are analysed using a narrative methodology. We draw on the social construction of technology and use the concept of relevant social groups to understand the different interests influencing the organisational dynamics. We complement this approach by employing the concepts of organisational power and cultural fit between the new system and the different subcultures. We found that this multiple approach explains well how the acceptance of the new software processes was interpreted differently within the organisation, and also by the software supplier. Although limited, our case study reveals the process of socially constructing the success or failure of an information system using this multiple research approach.

While the key users did not use the system as intended and the project goals were not achieved, the project committee reported success to the top management board. Using a multi-methodological approach, we can follow how different stakeholders attributed different meanings to the system introduced over time. The rhetorical tools used are analysed using a narrative methodology. We draw on the social construction of technology and use the concept of relevant social groups to understand the different interests influencing the organisational dynamics. We complement this approach by employing the concepts of organisational power and cultural fit between the new system and the different subcultures. We found that this multiple approach explains well how the acceptance of the new software processes was interpreted differently within the organisation, and also by the software supplier. Although limited, our case study reveals the process of socially constructing the success or failure of an information system using this multiple research approach. We compare our results with the literature on IS failures and we consider the value of combining constructionist and critical approaches through a narrative methodology.","['information systems failure', 'social construction of technology', 'narrative methodology', 'organisational power', 'organisational culture']",Nathalie Mitev,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Mitev%2C+Nathalie,"Department of ManagementInformation Systems and Innovation Group, London School of EconomicsLondonUK

One answer to this problem might be to adopt a systems approach to IS planning. At first sight this appears to be a good idea because of the aspiration of systems approaches to comprehensiveness, presumably looking beyond organisational concerns. However, a review of two popular systems methodologies employed in IS planning suggests that there is potential for their scope to be equally limited by organisational boundaries. There is a need to enhance the critical review of the boundaries of IS planning processes, enabling people to consider family, community and other concerns. In this paper, we use the systems theory of boundary critique to derive a set of questions to help practitioners reflect on different possible boundaries for IS planning exercises. These should be seen as complementary to existing systems approaches rather than as a replacement for them, enabling the latter to be practised more critically.

Our model of antecedents and consequences of SMMs demonstrates how cognitive capabilities contribute to effective software development teams. Higher scores on two meta-level cognitive skills (A-shaped skills and T-shaped skills) and a personality characteristic (agreeableness), which help teammates coordinate their skills and knowledge, enhance the development of an SMM and thereby enhance team performance. The results open new and important areas for research into both the meta-level cognitive skills and the agreeable characteristic required for team effectiveness.

This model elaborates the interdependent and asymmetric effects of inhibiting usage perceptions, such as resistance, on HIT usage intentions relative to enabling perceptions, such as perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use.

The resulting multi-level analysis contributes to understanding the innovation by revealing a highly complex process of interactions between key stakeholders and healthcare industry infrastructure.

The study contributes with contextual insights into the telehealth innovation, suggesting complementary explanations of why the healthcare industry despite considerable investments continues to lag behind other industries in adoption of IT-based innovations.

These applications allow patients to both communicate with their providers and access personal medical information, such as laboratory results. Research within medical informatics explores, and debates, the utility of such functions from the patient and physician perspectives. However, work does not examine factors influencing patient use, assuming that once built and deployed patients will come. Hence, the current research empirically investigates patient behavioral intentions (BI) with respect to (a) use of electronic communications functions and (b) accessing of individual medical information through an Internet-based patient–physician portal. Surveying 294 patients, this work incorporates individual factors, namely computer self-efficacy and personal innovativeness in the domain of information technology, with technology-based factors identified in the Technology Acceptance Model. The analysis finds that usefulness and innovativeness have a positive direct effect on BI with respect to both functions, namely communications and information access. Additionally, patients with greater healthcare needs foresee increased use of portals to access their personal medical information. Finally, patients in primary care, as opposed to specialist, provider settings intend to engage in electronic communications.","['computer self-efficacy', 'healthcare', 'patient–physician portals', 'personal innovativeness with information technology', 'TAM']",Richard Klein,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Klein%2C+Richard,"Department of ManagementCollege of Business and Behavioral Sciences, Clemson UniversityClemsonSouth CarolinaU.S.A.

We suggest that these misalignments can arise from incompatibility in the externally imposed or voluntarily adopted structures embedded in the organisation and package, as well as differences in the way the meaning of organisational reality is ontologically represented in the deep or surface structure of packages. The synthesis of the institutional-ontological dimensions leads us to identify four types of misalignments with varying degrees of severity – imposed-deep, imposed-surface, voluntary-deep, and voluntary-surface – and to predict their likely resolution. We test the predictions using over 400 misalignments from package implementations at three different sites. The findings support the predictions: the majority of imposed-deep misalignments were resolved via package customisation. Imposed-surface and voluntary-deep misalignments were more often resolved via organisational adaptation and voluntary-surface misalignments were almost always resolved via organisational adaptation.

It uses a revelatory case study of the very large network orchestrated by Manchester United Football Club, a global sporting and entertainment brand that is partnered by some of the most successful consumer brands in the world and has an estimated 70 million fans (MUFC, 2007). We use business process modelling and systems theoretical concepts to investigate the complex horizontal and vertical relationships between partner firms and then develop a multi-level model of network operation, sustainability and governance. Inter-organisational networks are open systems that are sustained far from equilibrium by the constant flow of materials, energy and information that we have called a ‘value flow system’. Here we model the flow of commercial ‘value’ through the network that sustains it in a far from equilibrium state. The contribution for managers of orchestrator firms is an architectural model of the properties and mechanisms of network orchestration that aids value flow for network building and maintenance. The implication for coordination researchers is a development of Malone and Crowston's coordination theory (1994) via the novel introduction of Hierarchy Theory to this domain.","['Manchester United', 'business process modelling', 'cultivation', 'network', 'orchestration', 'inter-organisational', 'B2B', 'open systems', 'Hierarchy Theory']",Duncan R Shaw,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Shaw%2C+Duncan+R,"Nottingham University Business SchoolNottinghamU.K.

While curriculum coherence can be jeopardized by poor curriculum design, misalignment between module content and/or misalignment between module or course aims can cause serious coherence issues over time. Misalignment of this type is exacerbated by the traditional processes of curriculum (re)design, which rely heavily on the (singular) interpretation of highly abstract documents, such as module syllabi and course specifications – often produced by curriculum designers in isolation. To improve curriculum coherence, this paper examines the use of a programme management framework as a means of (a) ‘humanizing’ the abstract aims and goals of curricula schemes and (b) managing the delivery and evolution of curricula in relation to the stakeholders in the process of delivery. The practical use of the framework is examined in the context of a Masters-level course in ‘Information Systems Management’. An action research approach is used to demonstrate the practical utility of the framework in terms of (a) improving communication of curricula, (b) improving the coherence between modules and between modules and course and (c) removing content redundancy. Analysis of outcomes demonstrates a significant positive impact of the use of the framework in relation to the above points from the perspective of all stakeholders.

While curriculum coherence can be jeopardized by poor curriculum design, misalignment between module content and/or misalignment between module or course aims can cause serious coherence issues over time. Misalignment of this type is exacerbated by the traditional processes of curriculum (re)design, which rely heavily on the (singular) interpretation of highly abstract documents, such as module syllabi and course specifications – often produced by curriculum designers in isolation. To improve curriculum coherence, this paper examines the use of a programme management framework as a means of (a) ‘humanizing’ the abstract aims and goals of curricula schemes and (b) managing the delivery and evolution of curricula in relation to the stakeholders in the process of delivery. The practical use of the framework is examined in the context of a Masters-level course in ‘Information Systems Management’. An action research approach is used to demonstrate the practical utility of the framework in terms of (a) improving communication of curricula, (b) improving the coherence between modules and between modules and course and (c) removing content redundancy. Analysis of outcomes demonstrates a significant positive impact of the use of the framework in relation to the above points from the perspective of all stakeholders.

The purpose of this paper is to present a journal ranking for business and management based on a statistical analysis of the Harzing data set which contains 13 rankings. The primary aim of the analysis is two-fold – to investigate relationships between the different rankings, including that between peer rankings and citation behaviour; and to develop a ranking based on four groups that could be useful for the RAE. Looking at the different rankings, the main conclusions are that there is in general a high degree of conformity between them as shown by a principal components analysis. Cluster analysis is used to create four groups of journals relevant to the RAE. The higher groups are found to correspond well with previous studies of top management journals and also gave, unlike them, equal coverage to all the management disciplines. The RAE Business and Management panel have a huge and unenviable task in trying to judge the quality of over 10,000 publications and they will inevitably have to resort to some standard mechanistic procedures to do so.

In this paper, we report a qualitative study of management practices in three hybrid teams in one organization. We adopt the theoretical approach of strategic contradiction, in which apparently contradictory pairs of elements can be managed by attending to their possible synergies or clarifying their distinctions so as to make balanced trade-offs over time. Our data reveal four sets of paradoxical frames in hybrid teams: remoteness–closeness, cultural uniformity–cultural diversity, rationality–emotionality, and control–empowerment. In referencing these paradoxical frames, teams engaged in three cognitive processes: (a) integrating to produce synergies between opposing tensions, (b) differentiating to clarify distinctions between opposing tensions and to balance trade-offs over time, and (c) polarizing to remove tensions between opposing elements by using one element to reduce the effects of another. Both integrating and differentiating processes were found to be instrumental to sustaining contradictions as interdependent dualities, whereas polarizing processes were found to preserve contradictions as dualisms. Our findings advance the understanding of managing strategic contradictions by showing how managers influence cognitive processes that paradoxically emphasize remoteness and closeness, cultural uniformity and cultural diversity, rationality and emotionality, and control and empowerment.","['virtual teams', 'hybrid teams', 'dualities']",Karlene C Cousins,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Cousins%2C+Karlene+C,"Department of Decision Sciences and Information SystemsCollege of Business, Florida International UniversityMiamiFLUSA

Following extensive literature review on innovation adoption–diffusion theories and qualitative field study, a research model was developed which treated six sets of antecedents of small business's attitude towards B2B trading exchanges. The findings revealed that external influences raise the small business's awareness of an innovation. This awareness leads to the evaluation of the perceived direct and indirect benefits and a positive evaluation leads to a positive attitude towards the innovation.

There has been far less research on the use of IT by customers, including technology at the point of sale (POS). The provision of customer-oriented IT at the POS implies integrating content in different formats and from different supply chain members in various devices. Therefore, research on such phenomena holds the potential to extend the literature on IT use, blending in perspectives that derive from content integration. This paper uses a case research method to describe the first real-world application of content integration at the POS. Literature on IT use and content integration guide the subsequent analysis. The paper offers some conclusions concerning content integration, customer use, and satisfaction.","['IT use', 'content integration', 'radio frequency identification (RFID)']",Claudia Loebbecke,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Loebbecke%2C+Claudia,"Department of Media ManagementUniversity of CologneCologneGermany

The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of the richness of consumers’ interaction with products and with sales representatives on changes in their attitude towards and their intention to use business-to-consumer (B2C) EC. Controlled lab experiments were conducted using two types of products and multiple levels of interaction richness. The results show that interaction richness has positive impact on consumers’ attitude towards B2C EC. Additionally, the study finds that the impact is stronger in the case of purchasing a high-complexity product than a low-complexity product, and that consumers’ attitude change is positively related with their intention to use B2C EC. Differential effects on two facets of attitude, ease of use in accomplishing the tasks and usefulness were observed leading to interesting implications and future research directions.","['change in attitude', 'usefulness', 'ease of use', 'intention to accept and use', 'electronic commerce', 'interaction richness']",Jungjoo Jahng,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Jahng%2C+Jungjoo,"Graduate School of Business, Seoul National UniversitySeoulSouth Korea

Generally, organizations base their decision to move forward with an information-sharing project on the project's expected benefits such as better services, operational savings, and increased program effectiveness. Clearly, potential impediments particular to the government environment could limit the attainment of benefits, jeopardizing the project's business case and even the project itself. Yet, we know very little about how users’ perceived impediments affect a project's expected benefits in collaborative digital government initiatives. Using data from six public sector information-sharing projects, this paper reveals how some managerial and cultural impediments (e.g., control-oriented management) limit perceptions of expected benefits. Surprisingly, political impediments were not found to significantly affect the expectations of benefits. Additionally, the paper provides managers with specific advice on how to better understand users’ perceptions and expectations. The paper should be of interest to both academicians and practitioners who are interested in government information technology implementation, in general, and collaborative e-Government, in particular.","['e-Government', 'collaboration', 'expected benefits', 'perceived impediments', 'information-sharing projects', 'user experience']",J Ramon Gil-Garcia,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Ramon+Gil-Garcia%2C+J,"Center for Technology in Government, University at Albany, State University of New York 187 Wolf Road, Suite 301 AlbanyNYU.S.A.

Clearly, potential impediments particular to the government environment could limit the attainment of benefits, jeopardizing the project's business case and even the project itself. Yet, we know very little about how users’ perceived impediments affect a project's expected benefits in collaborative digital government initiatives. Using data from six public sector information-sharing projects, this paper reveals how some managerial and cultural impediments (e.g., control-oriented management) limit perceptions of expected benefits. Surprisingly, political impediments were not found to significantly affect the expectations of benefits. Additionally, the paper provides managers with specific advice on how to better understand users’ perceptions and expectations. The paper should be of interest to both academicians and practitioners who are interested in government information technology implementation, in general, and collaborative e-Government, in particular.","['e-Government', 'collaboration', 'expected benefits', 'perceived impediments', 'information-sharing projects', 'user experience']",InduShobha Chengalur-Smith,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Chengalur-Smith%2C+InduShobha,"Information Technology Management DepartmentSchool of Business, University at Albany, State University of New York 1400 Washington Avenue AlbanyNYU.S.A.

Designing e-Government systems that help to meet these objectives is a significant challenge for the future. This paper develops an evaluative design framework for e-Government projects that complements traditional approaches to IS evaluation. The framework is based upon Moor's concept of public value. It focuses upon citizens' and clients' experiences of service provision and service outcomes as contributors to the formation of public trust. Trust is shown to be related to the extent to which people feel that an e-Government service enhances their sense of being well-informed, gives them greater personal control, and provides them with a sense of influence or contingency. The framework's development and validation are founded upon analyses of a two live case studies in south-east England and London, U.K.","['e-Government', 'information systems', 'evaluation', 'design', 'public value', 'trust']",Mike Grimsley,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Grimsley%2C+Mike,"Faculty of Arts, Computing, Engineering and Science, Sheffield Hallam UniversitySheffieldU.K.
