Privacy and security aspects are significant since last mile delivery drones operate outside the warehouse and are not under complete control of the delivery service operator. This is especially salient with respect to communications between the drone and outside entities that are not necessarily authorised for such communication by the operator. Even if such outside entities are authorised to communicate with the drone, while it is in the open, there may be restrictions on the types of information it can reveal to any given external entity. In addition to an overview of the main security and privacy issues in drone-based last mile delivery, we discuss general security and privacy issues and how these translate to drone-based last mile delivery. We consider various facets of issues related to privacy and security of drone-based last mile delivery. Specifically, we study risks associated with privacy and security in this environment with specific emphasis on those related to codes, external entities, and communication signals. We then identify some of the gaps in associated extant academic literature that could potentially be addressed in future studies.","['Drone', 'identifier', 'last mile delivery', 'privacy', 'RFID', 'security']",Yu-Ju Tu,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Tu%2C+Yu-Ju,,

However, the theoretical understanding of how users assess online news as real or fake has thus far remained incomplete. In particular, previous research cannot explain why users fall for fake news inadvertently and despite careful thinking. In this work, we study the role of affect when users assess online news as real or fake. We employ NeuroIS measurements as a complementary approach beyond self-reports, which allows us to capture affective responses in situ, i.e., directly in the moment they occur. We draw upon cognitive dissonance theory, which suggests that users experiencing affective responses avoid unpleasant information to reduce psychological discomfort. In our NeuroIS experiment, we measured affective responses based on electrocardiography and eye tracking. We find that lower heart rate variability and shorter mean fixation duration are associated with greater perceived fakeness and a higher probability of incorrect assessments, thus providing evidence of affective information processing. These findings imply that users may fall for fake news automatically and without even noticing. This has direct implications for information systems (IS) research and practice as effective countermeasures against fake news must account for affective information processing.","['Fake news', 'Social media', 'Affective information processing', 'Electrocardiography', 'Eye tracking', 'NeuroIS']",Bernhard Lutz,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Lutz%2C+Bernhard,"a Chair for Information Sytems, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany

By drawing on the socio-emotional selectivity perspective, we conduct a cohort analysis using the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging data and find that while online participation alone may increase loneliness, engaging in offline participation will make online participation beneficial. Loneliness serves as a mediating mechanism such that engaging in both online and offline social participation can indirectly enhance satisfaction with life by reducing loneliness. We further find a significant moderating effect of social support, which mitigates the negative impact of loneliness on life satisfaction.","['CLSA', 'online social participation', 'ageing', 'social support', 'loneliness', 'national survey']",Junyi Yang,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Yang%2C+Junyi,"b DeGroote School of Business, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada",

We find robust evidence that investors invest most in the morning, moderately in the afternoon, and least in the evening; they invest fastest in the afternoon, moderately in the morning, and slowest in the evening. Furthermore, the diurnal variations in terms of investment amounts and speed become more prominent in mobile-based interactions than in desktop-based interactions. Our findings contribute to the crowdfunding literature and provide managerial implications for crowdfunding platforms.","['Crowdfunding', 'lending-based crowdfunding', 'investment decisions', 'circadian rhythm', 'interaction modes']",Zhijie Lin,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Lin%2C+Zhijie,"c School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China

It typically involves splitting, where one model is further divided into several or even hundreds of narrow-scope models. The Information Systems (IS) literature does not discuss such splitting. On the contrary, many seminal IS studies report that a narrow scope is less strong, less interesting, or less useful than a wider scope. In this commentary, we want to raise the awareness of the IS community that in modern scientific progress, specialisation – an activity that generally narrows the scope and decreases the generalisability of a hypothesis – is important. The philosophy of science discusses such positive developments as splitting and trading off a wide scope in favour of accuracy. Narrowing the scope may increase value, especially in sciences where practical applicability is valued. If the IS community generally prefers a wider scope, then we run the risk of not having the information necessary to understand IS phenomena in detail. IS research must understand splitting, how it results in narrowing the scope, and why it is performed for exploratory or predictive reasons in variance, process, and stage models.","['Scope', 'unificationism', 'specialisation', 'IS philosophy', 'splitting', 'lumping']",Quan Xiao,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Xiao%2C+Quan,"c School of Information Management, Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics, Nanchang, China

Several industry and law enforcement reports have emphasised that AFF scamming is among the most pervasive forms of online social engineering attacks against consumers, organisations, and online users. Although AFF scamming has received significant attention worldwide, it remains an under-researched and poorly understood crime, and little work has focused on offenders.

The first was an initial qualitative study based on interviews with e-commerce practitioners in China, in which three factors of technology-driven MCP (physical, mental, and emotional) and two categories of loss (utilitarian and symbolic) were identified. The second quantitative study explored and validated the relationships between technology-driven MCP, perceived co-creation, experienced burnout, and online post-recovery satisfaction from a loss-aversion perspective. The theory-driven empirical findings provide recommendations for e-commerce businesses to enhance online service management.","['Experienced burnout', 'loss aversion', 'loss type', 'technology-driven mandatory customer participation', 'online post-recovery satisfaction', 'perceived co-creation']",Jose Benitez,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Benitez%2C+Jose,,shaobingjia@cqu.edu.cn

We theorise that SMEs rely on managerial activities to enable IT ambidexterity to enhance the performance of their new product development (NPD). To this end, we hypothesise and test the relationships between managerial activities, IT ambidexterity, and NPD performance. Using multiple respondent data from 292 high-tech SMEs, we find that managerial activities enable IT ambidexterity, and this relationship is moderated by structural configurations.

In hospitals, with their heterogeneous and powerful clinical departments, partial or non-adoption by some departments may jeopardise effective overall use. Viewing a hospital’s EHR adoption from a sociotechnical fit perspective, we unravel how clinical departments’ adoption of this organisation-wide system was primarily shaped by their critical work system dependencies rather than their role during its implementation. From the interviewees’ accounts, three orientations emerge: (1) organisation-oriented resulting in unconditional adoption; (2) department-oriented resulting in problematic or delayed adoption with high compromise costs; (3) environment-oriented resulting in at least partial non-adoption or extra design costs. Our subsequent analysis leads to the identification of four types of subunit-level characteristics influencing adoption. Their interplay informs departments in balancing between accepting compromise costs and negotiating design costs.

Merleau-Ponty redefines the human body beyond pure physicality, as material-semiotic processes between self and other. From this perspective, meaningful engagements are based on the intertwinement of bodily activities including gestures and displays. Drawing on a rich case of an exclusively virtual collaboration, this paper illuminates how bodily expressivity is rematerialised through digital technology. The findings show how distributed bodies pattern an intercorporeal armature constituted of processes of co-presencing, co-orienting, and co-investing. The paper problematises claims of virtual disembodiment and advances current understanding of how body and technology merge to make virtual collaboration possible. The rich empirical insights are synthesised into four main theoretical propositions that constitute a novel perspective on virtual intercorporeality. This perspective advances our understanding of virtual embodiment and elaborates the role of technology and language in the process of mutual attunement between bodies.","['Intercorporeality', 'virtual embodiment', 'Merleau-Ponty', 'body', 'gestures', 'collaboration']",Simeon P Vidolov,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Vidolov%2C+Simeon+P,"UCD College of Business, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland

Adopting large empirical data with approximately 31 million online reviews from Amazon.com, this study finds that the effect of trust cues on review helpfulness is significantly larger for moderate reviews, although the difference is negated for highly helpful reviews, and the effect is more considerable for extremely positive reviews than extremely negative reviews. The findings also disclose that the effect is more substantial for extreme reviews on search products and those on tangible products, suggesting that the differential effect depends on product attributes.","['Online reviews', 'eWOM', 'review helpfulness', 'confirmation bias', 'trust cues', 'search/experience products', 'tangible/intangible products', 'Amazon.com', 'big data']",Hoon S.

Based on argumentation theory, we advance that fallacies – a subset of well-known deceptive rhetorical devices – share a conceptual overlap with fake news and are therefore suitable for shedding light on the issue’s grey areas. In a first two-by-two, between-subject, best-worst scaling experiment (case 1), we empirically test whether fallacies are related to the perception of information as fake news and to what extent a reader can identify them. In a second two-by-two experiment, we presume that a reader believes that some of a sender’s messages contain fake news and investigate recipients’ subsequent reactions. We find that users distinguish nuances based on the applied fallacies; however, they will not immediately recognise some fallacies as fake news while overemphasising others.

Our theorising differs from extant literature in two important respects: 1) In contrast to the widespread acceptance of the diminishing effect of continuance intention on CSU in the information systems (IS) literature, we hypothesise that in our context, its impact increases with time; and 2) In contrast to the negative moderation effect of habit on the relationship between intention and CSU proposed in the literature, we posit a positive interaction effect. We collect longitudinal survey data on the use of a higher education IS from students in a European university. Our results suggest that the impact of continuance intention on CSU as well as the interaction effect between habit and intention are increasing over time. We further introduce a methodological innovation – the permutation approach to conduct the multi-group analysis with repeated measures – to the literature.","['Continued system use', 'habit', 'longitudinal research', 'continuance intention', 'volitional', 'utilitarian']",Jan-Michael Becker,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Becker%2C+Jan-Michael,,

To understand drivers for the heterogeneous changes, we further conduct qualitative interviews. We find habits were deliberately altered during COVID-19 and replaced with new intentions through sensemaking. We derive propositions that may encourage further research into the subject. Extended knowledge of post-adoptive behaviour and its triggers assists practitioners in adjusting to the new normal or reacting to new situations beyond COVID-19.","['Post-adoption', 'sensemaking', 'IS use', 'communication and collaboration']",Kathrin Neumeier,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Neumeier%2C+Kathrin,"a FIM Research Center, Augsburg, Germany;b University of Augsburg, Augsburg, Germany

To test the research model, a survey was conducted on 375 employees in the U.S. The results show that the challenge aspect of ISP demands elicits a positive psychological response of employees, which in turn triggers their planful problem-solving to deal with these demands. In contrast, the hindrance aspect of ISP demands provokes a negative psychological response that triggers employees’ wishful thinking about ISP demands. Meanwhile, employees’ self-efficacy strengthens the effect of positive psychological response on planful problem-solving.

Content providers have changed from providing merely content to offering social content experiences that allow users not only to passively consume content but also to actively participate. As the latest development, social live streaming services (SLSS) have emerged that enable so-called co-interactive behaviour, i.e., the live interplay between users while co-experiencing content. Yet, it remains unclear how co-interactive behaviour affects the monetisation of social live content. Based on a data set of 868,940 users from 59 gaming channels of the freemium-based SLSS Twitch, we empirically show that co-interactive behaviour has a stronger effect on users’ willingness to subscribe (WTS) than passive and active behaviour.

Business potentials are demonstrated mainly from the marketing perspective on servitization. However, increased digitalisation makes servitization interesting to other research areas. This paper applies the resource-based view (RBV) to argue how to value the data and explore its potential and impact on servitization. We examine the evolving role of information technology (IT), particularly of the Internet of Things (IoT), and the role of data in the servitization journey. This research is based on a longitudinal study of a product-oriented manufacturing company’s transformation towards servitization. The engagement with the company also includes the development of an IT platform that consolidates IoT and enterprise data, which enables managers to explore new data-based insights. Our goal is to investigate the organisation and in particular cross-functional effects of data-based insights and their impact on supporting strategic decision-making. The action design research (ADR) approach is applied to unfold the servitizing activities inside the organisation and extract the lesson learned into the joint domains of servitization and information systems research. First, we argued that exploring the value of data is becoming a more complex process. Rather than having one design perspective, technical concerns, business considerations, and operational purpose must be aligned to frame the value of data to support decision-making. Second, we discuss the emerging managerial implications, especially the role of IT in the transformation. A cross-functional team is a prerequisite to exploring complex transformation projects. Thus, managers must recognise the problematic situation and bootstrap the available organisational resources. Finally, we provide empirical evidence on how scholars and practitioners can address mutual interests by applying the ADR approach to a transformation project. In summary, servitizing a product-centric manufacturing firm to have a digital services business model is a transformation involving complex social and organisational relations. This study advocates resource-based analysis as a lens and demonstrates how IT and data as heterogeneous and imperfectly mobile resources create value for a product-oriented manufacturing company. However, a critical question remains on how to manage the expanding operational condition of a servitizing organisation and its business system to sustain its competitive advantage and win the digital market.","['Internet of Things (IoT)', 'digital servitization', 'digital transformation', 'action design research (ADR)', 'business system', 'resource-based view (RBV)']",Kuan-Lin Chen,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Chen%2C+Kuan-Lin,"Department of Materials & Production, Faculty of Engineering and Science, Aalborg University, Denmark

This research is based on a longitudinal study of a product-oriented manufacturing company’s transformation towards servitization. The engagement with the company also includes the development of an IT platform that consolidates IoT and enterprise data, which enables managers to explore new data-based insights. Our goal is to investigate the organisation and in particular cross-functional effects of data-based insights and their impact on supporting strategic decision-making. The action design research (ADR) approach is applied to unfold the servitizing activities inside the organisation and extract the lesson learned into the joint domains of servitization and information systems research. First, we argued that exploring the value of data is becoming a more complex process. Rather than having one design perspective, technical concerns, business considerations, and operational purpose must be aligned to frame the value of data to support decision-making. Second, we discuss the emerging managerial implications, especially the role of IT in the transformation. A cross-functional team is a prerequisite to exploring complex transformation projects. Thus, managers must recognise the problematic situation and bootstrap the available organisational resources. Finally, we provide empirical evidence on how scholars and practitioners can address mutual interests by applying the ADR approach to a transformation project. In summary, servitizing a product-centric manufacturing firm to have a digital services business model is a transformation involving complex social and organisational relations. This study advocates resource-based analysis as a lens and demonstrates how IT and data as heterogeneous and imperfectly mobile resources create value for a product-oriented manufacturing company. However, a critical question remains on how to manage the expanding operational condition of a servitizing organisation and its business system to sustain its competitive advantage and win the digital market.","['Internet of Things (IoT)', 'digital servitization', 'digital transformation', 'action design research (ADR)', 'business system', 'resource-based view (RBV)']",Astrid Lassen,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Lassen%2C+Astrid,"Department of Materials & Production, Faculty of Engineering and Science, Aalborg University, Denmark

Specifically, we theorise the influence of MBOMs’ DT readiness in terms of their growth and technology mindsets contributing to their DT learning resources and processes. Drawing on qualitative data from a series of structured interviews and focus groups with MBOMs and other key stakeholders in the Irish MB digital ecosystem, we identity three MBOM digital transformer archetypes comprising unique configurations of MBOMs’ growth and technology mindsets, namely: champion digital transformers, emerging digital transformers, and aspiring digital transformers. For each of these archetypes, we explore the different learning capabilities and mechanisms through which MBOMs manage and sustain their digital transformation efforts. Our findings offer theoretical contributions to the fields of digital transformation in microbusinesses, digital leadership, and digital capabilities. Our study also has significant implications for policy and practice.","['Digital transformation', 'mindset', 'microbusiness', 'readiness', 'owner-manager', 'learning', 'digital resilience', 'digital inclusion policy', 'digital transformation practices']",Niki Panteli,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Panteli%2C+Niki,,

Unfortunately, despite over a decade of research on the topic, the human aspect of security remains the most vulnerable in many companies today, often rooted in employee disinterest. Two traditions within the InfoSec research that may contribute to this disconnect are 1) emphasis on extrinsic manipulation of behaviour versus cultivation of internalised commitment to organisational InfoSec and 2) emphasis on isolated activities over more integrated perspectives of security behaviour. Addressing these gaps, the current study examines end user InfoSec behaviour through a distinct internal motivational lens. Rooted in Self-Determination Theory, a research model is introduced that highlights workplace factors which drive end users’ internalised commitment to organisational InfoSec by fulfiling fundamental psychological needs (autonomy, competence, and relatedness) within this context. Commitment, which captures internally regulated motivation to contribute to organisational InfoSec performance, is then positioned as a driver of intention to engage in various security behaviours. Overall, the results support the study’s hypotheses and underscore the important roles perceived behavioural control, IT competence, and user-IS department relations have on commitment to organisational InfoSec and resultant behavioural outcomes.","['Self-determination', 'information security', 'InfoSec engagement', 'InfoSec commitment', 'IT competence']",Joshua Davis,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Davis%2C+Joshua,"Correspondence

The specific context is the application of critical research in the problem definition phase of IS Design Science Research for sustainable development. The paper guides IS research through problem scenarios of unsustainable development where power can distort truth and corrupt the public discourse in the furtherance of their ambitions. The methodology provides a structured approach to engage in inquiry of topics which are by their nature, deceptive and opaque. The methodology enables research inquiry encompassing societal topics, macro-social issues related to sustainable development and the application of nomothetic inquiry to address systemic problems. The paper concludes with illustrative examples of outcomes from the application of the prescribed methodology. The study provides an IS response to systemic social and environmental challenges by identifying the routes to transformation which in turn inform the design of IS solutions. Consequently, the study lays a foundation for IS engagement in socially responsible design science research.","['Critical information systems research', 'critical research methodology', 'design science research', 'socially responsible design', 'sustainable development']",Mike Monson,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Monson%2C+Mike,"University of Twente, BMS Faculty, Enschede, Netherlands

Our review of existing PUTW studies (n = 137) suggests that previous studies widely discussed PUTW outcomes, antecedents, and policies. The literature review also indicates that previous studies proposed opposing viewpoints regarding the effect of PUTW on employee job performance, but few studies offered empirical evidence. Consequently, the conditions under which PUTW can increase or decrease employee job performance have not been discussed. We develop a theoretical model for increasing the understanding of this issue. Our model suggests that executive attention is an important underlying mechanism through which PUTW affects employee job performance. We further suggest the effect of PUTW on executive attention (and job performance) depends on PUTW behavioural characteristics in terms of four dimensions: PUTW cognitive load, PUTW arousal level, PUTW timing, and PUTW frequency/duration. The model can advance researchers’ understanding of the possible conditions under which PUTW may increase or decrease employee job performance. The model also offers new insights into existing studies on PUTW antecedents and policies. As a result, our proposed model provides new theoretical guidance for future studies on PUTW.","['Personal use of technology at work', 'literature review', 'executive attention', 'task-switching cost', 'job performance']",Aggeliki Tsohou,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Tsohou%2C+Aggeliki,"c Department of Informatics, Ionian University, Corfu, Greece",

Our findings have several implications for research and practice.","['Technical debt', 'nudging', 'psychological effects', 'clinical research', 'design science', 'software development']",Alexander W.Schneider,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/W.+Schneider%2C+Alexander,"c Credit Suisse Group AG, Zurich, Switzerland",

We also explain how different components of information management capability support improvisational agility, depending on the unexpected events and the need for speed or creativity.","['Organisational agility', 'organisational improvisation capability', 'ongoing agility', 'improvisational agility', 'sense-respond process', 'information management capability', 'unexpected events', 'organisational learning', 'case study']",Yolande Chan,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Chan%2C+Yolande,"b Desautels Faculty of Management, McGill University, Montreal, Canada

Information systems service providers seek to limit this value destruction but lack guidance on IS incident resolution actions that satisfy users and preserve IS service value. We apply Service-Dominant Logic (SDL) to explore what is relevant to users’ recovery service experiences while interacting with IS service providers. We use an integrated research approach including qualitative and quantitative data. We uncover actions that lead to a satisfying incident recovery and categorise them into three recovery components (responsive handling interactions, supportive communicating interactions, and effective resolving actions) that reflect IS provider resource exchanges of information, knowledge, and service skills with users in resolving incidents. We integrate these three recovery components as factors in our research model and test direct and moderating effects on value outcomes. We find that users’ recovery satisfaction results from both a “fix it fast and fully” perspective and a sense of effort and fairness conveyed.

Information systems service providers seek to limit this value destruction but lack guidance on IS incident resolution actions that satisfy users and preserve IS service value. We apply Service-Dominant Logic (SDL) to explore what is relevant to users’ recovery service experiences while interacting with IS service providers. We use an integrated research approach including qualitative and quantitative data. We uncover actions that lead to a satisfying incident recovery and categorise them into three recovery components (responsive handling interactions, supportive communicating interactions, and effective resolving actions) that reflect IS provider resource exchanges of information, knowledge, and service skills with users in resolving incidents. We integrate these three recovery components as factors in our research model and test direct and moderating effects on value outcomes. We find that users’ recovery satisfaction results from both a “fix it fast and fully” perspective and a sense of effort and fairness conveyed.

Yet, the pervasiveness of fake reviews jeopardises this reliability and questions the quality of this content. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence from a major online retailer that mitigation against fakery can be successful. To that end, we proposed, tested, and validated an approach, based on existing safeguards, to quantify the credibility of reviews and thus reliably reduce product uncertainty. We also showed that reviews with sufficient credibility signals were effective at influencing product sales, and this influence was prevalent for both niche and new products on the market. As such, this study offers a novel approach to mitigate the impact of fakery in reviews posted to online infomediaries. Our work focuses primarily on Amazon as a major retailer but also provides further support by drawing on Yelp, another major review platform.",['Pär Ågerfalk'],Wael Jabr,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Jabr%2C+Wael,"Supply Chain and Information Systems, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, USA

This paper contributes to the IS research by uncovering the interplay between the dark and bright sides of BDA and AI and the underlying mechanisms of cognitive appraisals for user behaviour in ridesharing. We performed two phases of the study using mixed-methods. In the first study, we conduct 21 semi-structured interviews to develop the research model. The second study empirically validated the research model using survey data of 332 passengers. We find that the usage of BDA and AI on ridesharing platforms have a bright side (usefulness, “the good”) but also a dark side (uncertainty and invasion of privacy, “the bad and the ugly”). The bright side generates perceived benefits, and the dark side shape perceived risks in users, which discount the risks from the benefits of using the ridesharing platform. Privacy control exerts a positive effect on the perceived benefits to encourage individuals to use the ridesharing platform.","['Patrick Mikalef, Aleš Popovic, Jenny Eriksson Lundström and Kieran Conboy']",Xusen Cheng,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Cheng%2C+Xusen,"a School of Information, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China

This study addresses this gap by investigating the role of IT-business operational alignment in inter-organisational relationships (IOR). Drawing on IT-based value-co creation and IT alignment literature, we propose that IOR IT-business operational alignment is an immediate source for co-creating business value and can be established through a capability-building process. Using a sample of 241 regional network collaborations in Germany, we find that IOR IT-business operational alignment directly affects relationship performance. Moreover, we find that three IOR IT capabilities – IT infrastructure integration, information exchange capability, and IT-enabled coordination – enable the development of IOR IT-business operational alignment. This study contributes to IS research on value co-creation by integrating the concept of IT-business alignment into a nomological network with well-established IOR IT capabilities. We provide theoretical explanations and empirical evidence that IT infrastructure integration, information exchange capability, and IT-enabled coordination indirectly affect relationship performance over an operational alignment process. For practice, we highlight the importance of monitoring IT-business operational alignment in IOR and provide recommendations on how to expand existing alignment efforts.",['Ojelanki Ngwenyama'],Simon Trang,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Trang%2C+Simon,"a Chair of Information Security and Compliance, University of Göttingen, Goettingen, Germany

Drawing on IT-based value-co creation and IT alignment literature, we propose that IOR IT-business operational alignment is an immediate source for co-creating business value and can be established through a capability-building process. Using a sample of 241 regional network collaborations in Germany, we find that IOR IT-business operational alignment directly affects relationship performance. Moreover, we find that three IOR IT capabilities – IT infrastructure integration, information exchange capability, and IT-enabled coordination – enable the development of IOR IT-business operational alignment. This study contributes to IS research on value co-creation by integrating the concept of IT-business alignment into a nomological network with well-established IOR IT capabilities. We provide theoretical explanations and empirical evidence that IT infrastructure integration, information exchange capability, and IT-enabled coordination indirectly affect relationship performance over an operational alignment process.

As a result, some ICT4D literature has examined the role of the researcher in reinforcing these biases and further exacerbating inequalities, thus highlighting the complex relationship between ICT4D researchers and the research process. Yet, most of this literature has focused on an insider/outsider researcher positionality. This paper explores the role of the researcher from the alternative position of in-betweenness, where researchers adopt more fluid and dynamic positions as reflexive spaces. To do this, we engage in a dialogical process of retrospective reflections based on ICT4D projects in Nigeria, Peru and West Africa. Through these cases, we identify how we experience in-betweenness in distinct ways: as liminal spaces, as performative spaces, and as spaces of disjuncture. We also examine how these forms of in-betweenness informed our research. We demonstrate that a researcher positionality of in-betweenness in ICT4D research can increase awareness of nuanced researcher roles and potentially avoid ethical dilemmas and reproducing biases.","['Irwin Brown, Kweku-Muata Osei-Bryson and Peter Meso']",Andrea Jimenez,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Jimenez%2C+Andrea,"Information School, University of Sheffield, UK

We therefore ask: To what extent does national culture shape the effect of social capital on perceived knowledge quality? We use survey data from two online communities from Germany and the Netherlands and demonstrate that the relationship between social capital and perceived knowledge quality differs in the two different national cultures, in particular for effects of reciprocity and shared vision.

But in the information technology (IT) industry, companies such as Google, Facebook and Microsoft have positively integrated play into the workplace. In an era when the digital is ubiquitous and where play with IT has become commonplace, exploring the nature of play at work could shed light on the broader question of how humans exist in the world. This is an essential question for contemporary Information Systems scholarship. Drawing on the critical hermeneutics of Hans-Georg Gadamer, I offer a narrative account of the instrumental aspects of play at work. I conducted an ethnographic study of the everyday practices of young IT professionals, revealing that workplace play has multiple instrumental aspects which are related to the temporality, spatiality, materiality and sociality of IT work practices.",['Frantz Rowe'],Hameed Chughtai,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Chughtai%2C+Hameed,"Southampton Business School, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK

I use a representational lens to explore how these systems can be made more useful. With this lens, the usefulness of these systems to convey information about the pandemic fundamentally depends on whether these systems are implemented as representation or state-tracking systems. I suggest that corona dashboards presently focus disproportionally on representing socially constructed properties (infection rates, deaths, levels of vaccination) of various things such as people, regions, or countries. They would become more useful if they additionally focused on tracking events (such as policy implementations) and changes in states (such as capacities of lockdown wards, usage of face masks). By applying a methodology for design science research involving design archaeology, I analyse the in situ implementation of Germany’s RKI COVID-19-Dashboard, develop new design principles to extend the state-tracking abilities of corona dashboards, and explore the importance, actability, and effectiveness of these design principles through an empirical case study. The contributions this paper makes are new and validated design principles for new feature implementations that can help making corona dashboards more effective and useful.","['Pär Ågerfalk, Kieran Conboy and Michael Myers']",Jan Recker,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Recker%2C+Jan,"University of Hamburg, Hamburg Business School, Hamburg, Germany

To assess the current state of NLP research in IS, we use a variety of techniques to analyse a literature corpus comprising 356 NLP research articles published in IS journals between 2004 and 2018.

Through an action design research (ADR) study with a forest department, we develop and test design principles for a class of wildlife management analytics system (WMAS). We identify the initial design principles, including elements of the action potential, materiality, and boundary condition, and iteratively refine them based on an instantiation of WMAS through two iterations of design and implementation cycles. Through our work, we contribute to design knowledge by abstracting the artefacts, design principles in particular, and the ADR approach by generalising two new activities and corresponding principles when designing analytical models. Our findings can also be used to address a class of similar problems and systems in practice.",['Pär Ågerfalk'],M.S. Sandeep,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Sandeep%2C+M+S,,

Since such complementors promise continuous value co-creation, complementor dedication is an essential objective of platform governance. However, as dedicated complementors also increase their vulnerability vis-à-vis the platform owner, platform governance needs to strike a balance between satisfying global ecosystem needs and the local partnership needs. To understand this challenge better, our study develops six hypotheses on how two fundamental governance mechanisms – i.e., rules and the way in which these rules are practised – independently and symbiotically drive complementor dedication. We test these hypotheses using survey data from 181 complementors. Our findings show that complementors become more dedicated to a platform owner, the more adequate they perceive the rules to be. Furthermore, our findings suggest two sensible strategies to actualise the potential of adequate rules. Platform owners should either refrain entirely from practising rules with situational flexibility and benevolence, thereby achieving moderate complementor dedication. Alternatively, they should practice rules with both flexibility and benevolence at the same time, thereby maximising complementor dedication.

We use a mixed method approach consisting of qualitative (n = 73) and quantitative (n = 150) studies and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to identify seven bitcoin-specific motivations (profit expectancy, ease of bitcoin acquisition, support of bitcoin ideology, investment skills, risk affinity, anticipated and experienced inaction regret) and how configurations of them explain bitcoin investment. The findings reveal, among others, that some individuals invest in bitcoin because they support the bitcoin ideology. Contrary to the traditional investment literature, profit expectancy is not a necessary condition to the extent that there is one empirical configuration of motivations that explains that individuals also invest in bitcoin even if they do not expect profits.

Specifically, businesses that require physical contact, such as mobility providers, have been severely impacted by the crisis. This paper reveals how mobility platforms and their ecosystem of actors have adapted faster than their non-platform competitors to become resilient. Whereas current research on resilience explicitly deals with the concept of organisational resilience, community resilience, or IT resilience, socio-technical characteristics of digital platforms have not been investigated. We build on a case survey approach, including heterogeneous qualitative evidence of 266 actions of 171 analysed mobility platforms. The results show five archetypes of how mobility platforms leverage their platform-based nature and the ecosystem to build resilience. Based on this, we develop the concept of platform ecosystem resilience as leveraging socio-technical factors of digital platforms and ecosystems frugally to design, deploy and use situation-specific responses to prepare for, endure and adapt by capturing new opportunities and engaging in transformative activities to cope with exogenous shocks and become resilient for future disruptions. Our results emphasise the importance of platform ecosystems for practitioners and policy planners to develop the “new normal” rather than resuming existing practices.","['Pär Ägerfalk, Kieran Conboy and Michael Myers']",N/A,N/A,N/A
