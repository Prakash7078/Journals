As the response to COVID-19 has reduced face-to-face contact, communication via social media has increased. Evidence shows that social media affects disease (non-)prevention through the (im)proper distribution of information, and distorts the predictive accuracy of infection models, including legacy Susceptible–Exposed–Infectious–Recovered (SEIR) models. Our adjusted SEIR model reflects the effectiveness of information disseminated through social media by accounting for dimensions of social/informational motivation based on social learning/use and gratification theories, and uses Monte Carlo methodology and computational algorithms to predict effects of social media on the spread of COVID-19 (N = 2,095 cases). The results suggest that social media utilisation measures should be incorporated into SEIR models to improve forecasts of COVID-19 infections. Utilising IS to analyse the spread of digital information via social media platforms can inform efforts to combat the pandemic and infodemic. Agencies responsible for infection and disease control, policy makers, businesses, institutions and educators must accurately monitor infection rates to appropriately allocate funding and human resources and develop effective disease prevention marketing campaigns.","['Pär Ågerfalk, Kieran Conboy and Michael Myers']",Sujin Bae,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Bae%2C+Sujin,"a School of Management, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea (The Republic Of)

Nevertheless, staying active is important for individual well-being and professional athletes need to compete to earn their living. We propose that mixed-reality applications like ZWIFT allow people to conduct virtually mediated sports competitions, which resemble traditional sport realistically and could serve as a remedy for this contradiction. To test this proposition, we compare professional cyclists’ performance data from virtual competitions with data obtained from traditional cycling races and find that the physical activities are comparable. Thus, we contribute to the discussion on the distinctiveness of sports and eSport. Moreover, we interview 11 professional cyclists, who participated in virtual race series regarding their evaluation of the virtualisation of cycling events. Accordingly, we contribute to the literature on mixed-reality applications by focusing on user perceptions of a novel and physical dimension of virtually mediated interaction. Thereby, we apply the sports digitalisation framework proposed by Xiao et al. (2017). Professional athletes mainly perceive the virtualisation of sport as positive, but also mention some specific risks. Consequently, we derive implications for practice that include the supportive role of virtual sport to help master pandemics such as COVID-19.","['Pär Ågerfalk, Kieran Conboy and Michael Myers']",Daniel Westmattelmann,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Westmattelmann%2C+Daniel,"Center for Management, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany

Despite the criticality of this strategy, there is little research that provides insights into partnership formation. Our study attempts to close this gap.Building on resource dependency theory (RDT) and resource-based view (RBV), we posit that, depending on external market and internal resource considerations, small IT vendors either supplement or complement their IT resources and capabilities via partnerships. When seeking to expand the scope of their resource portfolio by accessing dissimilar resources, vendors are engage in complementary partnerships (goal: improving the scope of IT resources). However, if they seek to expand the scale of their portfolio, they engage in supplementary partnerships (goal: extending the scale of IT resources). Using a qualitative approach, we examine the partnership formation practices of seven small IT firms. We propose a conceptual framework with five constructs that illustrate dynamics underlying these IT service partnerships, i.e., External market considerations, Internal resource configurations, Partner considerations, Partnership exploration, and Partnership development. We find variations in partnership practices depending on the supplementary or complementary nature of resources being sought. We also find small IT vendors form and manage partner pools to mitigate risks associated with partnerships.",['Frantz Rowe'],N Melike Findikoglu,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Findikoglu%2C+N+Melike,"a Management Information Systems, Ozyegin University, Istanbul, Turkey

When seeking to expand the scope of their resource portfolio by accessing dissimilar resources, vendors are engage in complementary partnerships (goal: improving the scope of IT resources). However, if they seek to expand the scale of their portfolio, they engage in supplementary partnerships (goal: extending the scale of IT resources). Using a qualitative approach, we examine the partnership formation practices of seven small IT firms. We propose a conceptual framework with five constructs that illustrate dynamics underlying these IT service partnerships, i.e., External market considerations, Internal resource configurations, Partner considerations, Partnership exploration, and Partnership development.

The human body influences the ways in which a person interprets and uses technology. Although we bodily engage with our world (people, things and places), we generally take our bodies for granted, and view them as passive recipients in studies on information technologies and organisational phenomena. Theoretical frameworks built on embodiment indicate that human beings are embedded in their social context, but they do not often include the human body with its somatic aspects (such as orientation, position and movement). Using a theoretically informed ethnographic case, I draw attention to how the human body affects the ways in which we interpret and use technology. The findings suggest revisiting the idiosyncratic view of human embodiment, which often overlooks somatic orientations and modes of engagement. The article contributes a theoretical framework relevant for inquiry into the structure of somatic practices in information systems. I conclude with a discussion of the implications for theory and practice.",['Frantz Rowe'],Hameed Chughtai,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Chughtai%2C+Hameed,"Southampton Business School, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland

In particular we examine how client-facing employees can foster a sense of belonging when they are not co-located. We use an abductive research approach, combining empirical material from interviews with tele-nurses with theoretical material from Goffman’s categories of “communication out of character”. We thereby theorise what we call “belonging through technology”, as the outcome of four types of team communication that contribute to the performance of effective client-facing work in a remote context. We distinguish and conceptualise functions of such team communication as coping, learning, plotting, and positioning, which together create belonging.

Both artefacts were designed to identify the security threats that trainees are most susceptible to, debrief them about the threat and its potential consequences, and facilitate behaviour change by letting trainees re-evaluate their decisions. Using a longitudinal randomised controlled experiment, we compared these two artefacts to no intervention and traditional security warning emails by assessing both instrumental (changes in attitudes, intentions, and OSD behaviour) and experiential (memorability and user experience) outcomes. Our survey of 1,718 employees showed that the text-based artefact was better at improving instrumental outcomes, and the visual-based artefact was better at improving experiential outcomes. This study provides a more granular understanding of the linkages between technology artefacts and human experiences through the application of design science thinking.

However the innovation process through which IT use influences patent inventions is largely unclear. We draw on the knowledge recombination perspective and develop a model that explains the innovation process through which IT use influences innovation outcomes by looking into a firm’s efforts to recombine existing knowledge (i.e., knowledge recombinant intensity) and the scope of knowledge that is recombined by a firm (i.e., knowledge recombinant diversity). We also distinguish innovation outcomes in terms of patent quantity and quality. Using a large-scale panel dataset, we show that IT use has a stronger impact on knowledge recombinant intensity relative to knowledge recombinant diversity. Moreover, knowledge recombinant intensity and knowledge recombinant diversity play key mediating roles in the relationships between IT use and patent inventions. The impact of IT use on patent quantity is partially mediated, while the impact of IT use on patent quality is fully mediated. Our findings indicate that while IT use can directly affect patent quantity, its impact on patent quality must be channelled through a firm’s knowledge recombinant efforts and scope.",['Dov Te’eni'],John Qi Dong,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Dong%2C+John+Qi,"Faculty of Economics and Business, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands

We draw on the knowledge recombination perspective and develop a model that explains the innovation process through which IT use influences innovation outcomes by looking into a firm’s efforts to recombine existing knowledge (i.e., knowledge recombinant intensity) and the scope of knowledge that is recombined by a firm (i.e., knowledge recombinant diversity). We also distinguish innovation outcomes in terms of patent quantity and quality. Using a large-scale panel dataset, we show that IT use has a stronger impact on knowledge recombinant intensity relative to knowledge recombinant diversity. Moreover, knowledge recombinant intensity and knowledge recombinant diversity play key mediating roles in the relationships between IT use and patent inventions. The impact of IT use on patent quantity is partially mediated, while the impact of IT use on patent quality is fully mediated. Our findings indicate that while IT use can directly affect patent quantity, its impact on patent quality must be channelled through a firm’s knowledge recombinant efforts and scope.",['Dov Te’eni'],Chia-Han Yang,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Yang%2C+Chia-Han,"Institute of Creative Industries Design, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan City, Taiwan",

What the rise and fall of OR/MS can teach us about the future of business analytics,Issue 5,"Volume 28, 2019 - Issue 5","Business analytics (BA) is an important organisational activity and research discipline. However, history has shown that information systems (IS)-related disciplines with promising futures do not always flourish as expected. The troubled history of one such discipline (i.e., operations research/management science, or OR/MS) serves as a cautionary tale for the BA community because it warns of the dangers of an unquestioning faith in the power of mathematical modelling and analysis. This cautionary tale is especially alarming given the methodological similarities between BA and OR/MS, as well as the sizeable investments organisations have made in their BA capabilities. It is, therefore, appropriate and prudent to ask if a similar fate could befall BA and how such a fate can be avoided. Those questions are addressed in this article by extracting “lessons learned” from the OR/MS literature and applying them to BA. The lessons highlight opportunities and challenges to BA which are then framed within a widely cited research agenda. Theoretical propositions are forwarded to encourage research that can help promote the future of BA – both as an organisational practice and research stream – through a wider, broad-based, and balanced critical discourse among scholars and practitioners.",['Frantz Rowe'],Robert F.

Based on the adaptive structuration theory (AST), it is proposed that employees’ exploration of an ES is mainly influenced by three fundamental components at different theoretical levels: task, technology, and the organisational environment.

This research employs an affordance lens rooted in the individual perspective of Activity Theory to examine personal information systems built around wearable sensors. Since wearable devices have size constraints, designers have produced a variety of simple technology products lacking screens and buttons, but supplemented with customised apps. Due to their novelty, the impact of these minimalist wearables on the quality of the user experience is not yet well understood. To investigate this issue, this study proposes a theoretically driven framework of affordances and applies it to qualitatively analyse a sample of online user reviews from a specific fitness tracker wristband. The findings suggest that minimalist wearables produce a more complex user experience if affordances are not properly balanced and combined. Specific usability challenges stem from affordance integration failures and inconsistencies. These results have theoretical and practical implications. Overall, an affordance lens offers a unified view of user experience that is valuable for researchers and practitioners seeking to understand what makes modern wearable information systems transparent to use at the physical and digital level.",['Kieran Conboy'],Raquel Benbunan-Fich,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Benbunan-Fich%2C+Raquel,"Baruch College, City University of New York, New York, NY, USA

Product type – specifically, whether a product is utilitarian or hedonic – can help explain how consumers react to reviews. Characteristics of reviews – in particular, valence, measured by ratings, the arousal level of the language used in the text and the volume of the reviews – provide heuristics that consumers may use in making purchase decisions. Product type moderates the effect of these characteristics. Empirical evidence for this claim comes from multiple sources: a panel data analysis of 26,357 Amazon products and an online experiment with 541 participants. The findings of studies based on this evidence show that product type (hedonic or utilitarian) moderates the effect of the three heuristic attributes of online reviews (valence, volume, and arousal) on sales. The analysis uses OLS-fixed effects models and Granger causality tests. These findings explain why past studies have found that sometimes online review valence is more influential than volume and arousal with respect to sales and why sometimes this is reversed.

Because of incomplete contracts and relationship-specific investments, client organisations may face switching costs, which in some cases may be large enough to render vendor switching an unattractive option. Based on an extensive review of the literature, we develop hypotheses about relationship-, firm-, and market-specific determinants of switching costs. We then develop an econometric model to identify those determinants and their relative importance and estimate the magnitude of switching costs. In the empirical study, we observe accounting data of 1318 US credit unions (CUs) and follow their IT outsourcing choices over 11 years. We find that the largest portion of switching costs is due to relationship- and firm-specific factors, while market-specific variables are much less important. Our estimates suggest that average switching costs account for one-third of the average annual expenditure for professional services. We further highlight that the average hides substantial heterogeneity. Switching costs of CUs that decide to switch vendors are about 50% lower than those of CUs that stay. Looking more closely at stayers, our most conservative estimate of the lock-in effect, i.e., the difference in switching costs of deliberate and non-deliberate stayers, is equivalent to about 70% of the average annual expenditure for professional services.",['Frantz Rowe'],Christian Peukert,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Peukert%2C+Christian,"Católica-Lisbon School of Business and Economics, Lisbon, Portugal

The favourable potential of these activities is likely to be particularly pronounced among adolescents who pay special attention to social acceptance, which can be channelled with the help of reciprocal communication. Therefore, we conducted a quantitative 7-day diary study of 162 adolescent Facebook users attending German schools, looking at the impact of their daily SNS activities on their SWB. Based on a linear mixed model analysis, our results confirm a positive link between targeted reciprocity-evoking activities – such as chatting, giving and receiving feedback – and adolescents’ positive emotions. Our findings provide a reassuring perspective on the implications of the sociotechnical design of SNS communication channels.

In the USA, 29 million people (or 9.3% of the population) suffer from the chronic disease of diabetes; according to the WHO, globally around 200 million people are diabetic. Left unchecked, diabetes can lead to acute and long-term complications and ultimately death. Diabetes prevalence tends to be the highest among those aged 65 and older (nearly 20.6%), a population which often lacks the cognitive resources to deal with the daily self-management regimens. In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of an Internet-of-Things (IoT) and wireless sensor system which patients use in their own homes to capture daily activity, an important component in diabetes management. Following Fogg’s 2009 persuasion theory, we mine the activity data and provide motivational messages to the subjects with the intention of changing their activity and dietary behaviour. We introduce a novel idea called “persuasive sensing” and report results from two home implementations that show exciting promise. With the captured home monitoring data, we also develop analytic models that can predict blood glucose levels for the next day with an accuracy of 94%. We conclude with lessons learned from these two home case studies and explore design principles for creating novel IoT systems.","['Internet-of-Things', 'persuasive systems', 'design science research', 'diabetes', 'mobile phones', 'neural networks']",Samir Chatterjee,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Chatterjee%2C+Samir,"Center of Information Systems and Technology, Claremont Graduate University, Claremont, USA

Following Fogg’s 2009 persuasion theory, we mine the activity data and provide motivational messages to the subjects with the intention of changing their activity and dietary behaviour. We introduce a novel idea called “persuasive sensing” and report results from two home implementations that show exciting promise. With the captured home monitoring data, we also develop analytic models that can predict blood glucose levels for the next day with an accuracy of 94%. We conclude with lessons learned from these two home case studies and explore design principles for creating novel IoT systems.","['Internet-of-Things', 'persuasive systems', 'design science research', 'diabetes', 'mobile phones', 'neural networks']",Jongbok Byun,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Byun%2C+Jongbok,"Forbes School of Business and Technology, Ashford University, San Diego, USA

To shed light on the underlying mechanisms through which appraisals influence task-level escalation, we proposed and tested two mediating pathways based on goal orientation theory and prospect theory.

These results extend the existing research on firm-level effects of IT investments by demonstrating that different IT capital effects have unique ways of affecting firm performance.","['Disaggregate IT capital effects', 'firm performance over time', 'profitability improvement', 'sales growth', 'cost efficiency', 'theory of production', 'panel data method']",Dr. Jason Thatcher,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Thatcher%2C+Jason,"Broad College of Business, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA",

In this essay, we suggest a philosophical foundation and epistemological basis for futures-oriented research to advance such scholarship in the IS field. We first highlight epistemic assumptions about futures-oriented research drawn from the discourse of futures studies. We then draw on Feenberg’s philosophy of “potentiality and actuality” of technology as a foundation to consider how knowledge generated through IS research about the sociotechnical past and present might inform futures-oriented inquiry. We illustrate these arguments with examples from the emerging arena of “big data” research.","['Ethics', 'futures studies', 'potentiality', 'philosophy of technology']",Pär J.

In recent years DSR has become a well-accepted research paradigm within IS; however, now the diversity of purpose, methodology, and mental models has increased to a point where reviewers and editors are unsure about which standards to apply to particular research submissions. For some researchers an artefact of value is a system or system component, while for others artefacts ought to be theories or theory components. Such differences are hard to reconcile and researchers often face criticism from diverse corners of the paradigm, where beliefs and standards are very different.

Repurposing electric vehicle batteries for second-life application scenarios may lower the vehicles’ total costs of ownership and increases their ecologic sustainability. However, identifying the best – or even a feasible – scenario for which to repurpose a battery is a complex and unresolved decision problem. In this exaptation research, we set out to design, implement, and evaluate the first decision support system that aids decision-makers in the automobile industry with repurposing electric vehicle batteries. The exaptation is done by classifying decisions on repurposing products as bipartite matching problems and designing two binary integer linear programs that identify (a) all technical feasible assignments and (b) optimal assignments of products and scenarios. Based on an empirical study and expert interviews, we parameterize both binary integer linear programs for repurposing electric vehicle batteries. In a field experiment, we show that our decision support system considerably increases the decision quality in terms of hit rate, miss rate, precision, fallout, and accuracy. While practitioners can use the implemented decision support system when repurposing electric vehicle batteries, other researchers can build on our results to design decision support systems for repurposing further products.","['Model-driven decision support system', 'design science research', 'binary integer linear programming', 'bipartite matching problem', 'electric vehicle battery']",N/A,N/A,N/A,
