In particular, the enhancement of electricity systems through IT components, resulting in smart grid and smart home solutions, is experiencing increasing adoption rates in advanced and developing countries alike. Due to the substantial interdependence with and reliance on often decades-old legacy infrastructure, these cyberphysical systems present particular opportunities and challenges for the associated information systems. We propose that one channel through which information systems improve cyberphysical systems is by enhancing the components of the legacy system with new features. Introducing the Design–Interference Model, we conceptualize IS design for cyberphysical systems and outline possible obstacles and interferences associated with it. Using a simulation experiment for a smart grid application as a showcase, we derive insights into how to address these challenges. We condense these results into actionable advice that, first, seeks to validate existing guidelines for design-oriented research, second, extends and focuses them on cyberphysical system applications and, third, provides guidance to researchers and practitioners in this increasingly relevant area of information system development.","['Design science', 'cyberphysical Systems', 'design-interference model', 'smart grid', 'sustainability']",N/A,N/A,N/A

We identify initial design principles based on salient affordances required in organisational sensemaking and revise them through three rounds of developing, demonstrating and evaluating a prototypical implementation. Through our analysis, we learn how IS can support essential sensemaking practices in environmental sustainability transformations, including experiencing disruptive ambiguity through the provision of environmental data, noticing and bracketing, engaging in an open and inclusive communication and presuming potential alternative environmentally responsible actions. We make two key contributions: First, we provide a set of theory-inspired design principles for IS that support sensemaking in sustainability transformations, and revise them empirically using a DSR method. Second, we show how the concept of affordances can be used in DSR to investigate how IS can support organisational practices. While our findings are based on the investigation of the substantive context of environmental sustainability transformation, we suggest that they might be applicable in a broader set of contexts of organisational sensemaking and thus for a broader class of sensemaking support systems.","['Sensemaking', 'sustainability', 'green IS', 'design science research']",N/A,N/A,N/A

Seeking to build on and extend the theory of knowledge reuse, this paper focuses on the various roles individuals play in knowledge exchange, and how the knowledge exchange role mediates the effect of previously studied individual perceptual variables (perceived time pressure, extrinsic and intrinsic rewards, and knowledge contribution self-efficacy) on EKR performance impact. In order to identify the various knowledge exchange roles, we simultaneously consider both knowledge contribution process (embedded vs. separate activity) and knowledge reuse (internal EKR, external EKR, colleagues, manuals, knowledge self-reliance). When work is highly specialised and technical as in the context of system administrators, we observed four roles: Self-reliant Contributors, Detached Moderates, Involved Brokers, and Reluctant Limited Users. Results indicate that the effects of intrinsic rewards and knowledge contribution self-efficacy on EKR performance impact are fully mediated by knowledge exchange role. Perceived time pressure does not influence either knowledge exchange roles or EKR performance impact.

In testing a theory-based trust model, we find that forum users accept advice more readily as they develop cognitive trust (trust based on a cognitive assessment) and/or affective trust (trust based on an emotional connection). Affective trust is also closely related to formation of relational closeness. This indicates that, while both forms of trust are important, the development of emotional connections provides for long-term OHCs interactions. Findings here, indicate that prior exchanges are not needed to access and utilise OHC community resources. However, trust (developed through prior exchanges) is required for a recipient to leverage the contributor’s social capital for information adoption and relational closeness. These findings allow the distribution of social capital to be viewed in terms of an asymmetrical model where it is possible to accept capital, in the form of advice, without first demonstrating trustworthiness. In the OHC setting the onus is on the contributor of advice to establish trustworthiness, whereas traditionally social capital theory requires receivers of capital to establish trust. These findings are important for site designers and provide insight to managers and developers of OHCs regarding the behaviours and motivations of forum users.","['Cognitive trust', 'affective trust', 'online health community', 'social capital', 'relational closeness']",Frantz Rowe,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Rowe%2C+Frantz,"School of Computing and Information Systems, University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",

As organisations accumulate their constituencies’ PII (e.g. customers’, students’, patients’, and employees’ data), individuals’ privacy will depend on the adequacy of organisations’ information privacy safeguards. Despite existing protections, many breaches still occur. For example, US organisations reported around 4,500 PII-breach events between 2005 and 2015. With such a high number of breaches, determining all threats to PII within organisations proves a burdensome task. In light of this difficulty, we utilise text-mining and cluster analysis techniques to create a taxonomy of various organisational PII breaches, which will help drive targeted research towards organisational PII protection. From an organisational systematics perspective, our classification system provides a foundation to explain the diversity among the myriad of threats. We identify eight major PII-breach types and provide initial literature reviews for each type of breach. We detail how US organisations differ regarding their exposure to these breaches, as well as how the level of severity (i.e. number of records affected) differs among these PII breaches. Finally, we offer several paths for future research.","['personally identifiable information (PII)', 'breach analysis', 'taxonomy development', 'privacy', 'confidentiality']",A. J.

The findings reveal that CEO fixed pay and bonus negatively affect the execution of the two types of IT-based environmental strategies, green IT strategies and IT-enabled green strategies, whereas CEO stock option positively influences such execution. The moderation analysis further highlights that while competitive intensity reinforces the positive impact of CEO stock option on both strategies, it weakens the negative impact of CEO fixed pay and bonus only on IT-enabled green strategies.

The findings reveal that CEO fixed pay and bonus negatively affect the execution of the two types of IT-based environmental strategies, green IT strategies and IT-enabled green strategies, whereas CEO stock option positively influences such execution. The moderation analysis further highlights that while competitive intensity reinforces the positive impact of CEO stock option on both strategies, it weakens the negative impact of CEO fixed pay and bonus only on IT-enabled green strategies.

Unfortunately, current models of trust and distrust have limitations that impede explanations of how – or even if – ambivalence is generated by feelings of trust and distrust and how these two constructs can best coexist. We thus propose a hybrid model which considers the limitations and strengths of previous models. Namely, we posit that trust and distrust can coexist as separate components with related continua. We use polynomial regression analysis (PRA) and response surface analysis (RSA) to test these complex relationships. Using an empirical study of online consumer behaviour with 521 experienced online consumers, strong empirical validation is found for the model. We examine the effects of ambivalence on the truster’s intentions towards a website and find a small positive effect which increases such intentions. PRA and RSA confirm that trust and distrust are most likely separate components – not opposite ends of a continuum – with related continua. The continua within the subconstructs of trust and distrust likely have more complex and interesting relationships than have been considered previously.

Previous research mostly assesses online self-disclosure from the rational approach of anticipated benefits and privacy risks without considering the “privacy paradox” phenomenon (users behave contrarily to privacy concern) in social networking sites (SNSs). We develop a theoretical model, grounded in constraint-based (lock-in) and dedication-based (trust-building) mechanisms and social identity theory, to predict online self-disclosure. We test the proposed theoretical model by surveying 395 consumers with participation experience in an online SNS. Different from the rational approach behind personalization, we advance knowledge on how to apply social identity, as well as constraint-based and dedication-based mechanisms, to motivate online self-disclosure induced by consumers.

2010) call for research on experiential computing, the paper suggests meditations as a genre for both doing and reporting on fieldwork. Meditations are used to engender passionate renderings of research encounters that are part introspective and reflective and part causative and instructive. The meditations weave together everyday experiences with IT with theoretical reflections on embodiment and affect, and suggest the potential for a new scholarly sensuousness. The paper suggests that paying attention to feelings related to technology in everyday life and the use of alternative representational tactics and theoretical motifs can be generative of new matters for empirical research. Emphasizing the senses and the body and their importance in developing a sensory apprenticeship in IS, the paper suggests alternative routes to knowledge and representation.","['affect', 'embodiment', 'experience', 'methods']",Mads Bødker,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/B%C3%B8dker%2C+Mads,,

For this, it invites explorations on the role of the body and its affective propulsions as the locus of human experience. I argue, in this article, that this embodied perspective, studied through the lens of enchanted materialism (Bennett in The enchantment of modern life: attachments, crossings, and ethics. Princeton University Press, Princeton,
2001), needs to be combined with an alternative writing genre to fruitfully explore life in experiential computing. It is for this reason that I present my research as a memoir on the use of wearables – an instantiation of the Internet of Things – in everyday life. The aim is to show that, when studying emerging technologies, an open-ended non-fictional genre like the memoir can produce astute and imaginative insights that may be as informative as traditional academic writing. The memoir produces a thick description of the way people interact with digital devices in experiential computing; their expectations and the subsequent effort to entangle the data in their daily lives. This way, it problematises current organising visions of a data-driven life. I conclude the article with reflections on the contribution that enchanted materialism makes to information systems, as well as the memoir’s potential for academic research.","['memoir', 'human body', 'experiential computing', 'enchanted materialism', 'wearables', 'Internet of Things']",Elpida Prasopoulou,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Prasopoulou%2C+Elpida,,

In writing them, researchers move beyond the “realistic” tale to frame coherent organizational metaphors and symbols and to offer a multi-layered truth that lies “between the lines” in the often subconscious spaces of organizational life. As such, this genre offers an evocative, yet concise alternative to traditional approaches for information systems research. Drawing on a 2-year cultural study of strategic alignment of IT in two insurance organizations as illustrative context, the allegory is introduced and demonstrated in five steps to guide researchers in creating their own allegories. This illustration uses allegory to recast diverse cultural and historical data into short stories that involve magic dragons and wizards, thereby demonstrating the usefulness of the genre for comparative, multi-case designs to translate organizational features to achieve a common representation. In conclusion, the paper offers reflections on how the genre of allegory may contribute to future information systems research, to alternative styles of presentation, and to reflexive practices.","['allegory', 'IT Culture', 'IT alignment', 'magic', 'metaphor and symbols', 'writing qualitative research']",Michelle Lynn Kaarst-Brown,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Kaarst-Brown%2C+Michelle+Lynn,"School of Information StudiesSyracuse University 218 Hinds Hall 13244SyracuseNYUSA

However, the nature of decision making processes regarding the adoption and use of IOS-enabling technologies has received little research attention. The authors explore approaches to decision making relating to SMEs’ use of these technologies and outline the drivers and implications of such decision making. Data were collected through two crosssectional surveys and multiple case studies. The surveys allowed for the identification of two groups of three SMEs each—the first group increased and the second group decreased the use of IOS-enabling technologies over time. This identification provided the context of strategic change or transition in the use of these technologies over time. The study’s results challenge widely held assumptions about the performance benefits of higher-level, deliberate planning over functional-level, emergent decision making regarding SMEs’ technological choices.

However, the nature of decision making processes regarding the adoption and use of IOS-enabling technologies has received little research attention. The authors explore approaches to decision making relating to SMEs’ use of these technologies and outline the drivers and implications of such decision making. Data were collected through two crosssectional surveys and multiple case studies. The surveys allowed for the identification of two groups of three SMEs each—the first group increased and the second group decreased the use of IOS-enabling technologies over time. This identification provided the context of strategic change or transition in the use of these technologies over time. The study’s results challenge widely held assumptions about the performance benefits of higher-level, deliberate planning over functional-level, emergent decision making regarding SMEs’ technological choices.

Yet despite much investigation, the effect of strategic IT alignment on organizational performance remains unclear, with mixed results reported in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to advance our understanding of mixed findings in IT alignment research. We first examine inconsistent findings reported in two streams of alignment research: the traditional firm-level IT alignment literature and the emerging literature into process-level IT alignment. We then empirically investigate whether firm- and process-level conceptualizations of IT alignment lead to different conclusions about the effect of alignment on performance. Using data from a survey of 120 firms, we show that firm-level IT alignment and process-level IT alignment yield different conclusions when testing the same theory under the same conditions. We also show that differences in firms’ strategic orientations can help explain these results. This research provides evidence that firm- and process-level conceptualizations of IT alignment are not interchangeable and that the choice of conceptualization can mean the difference between accepting and rejecting a theory.","['IT alignment', 'profile deviation', 'construct conceptualization', 'mixed results', 'strategic orientation', 'performance']",Magno Queiroz,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Queiroz%2C+Magno,"Management Information Systems, Jon M.

The extant studies on organisational privacy compliance concentrate on the extent to which privacy threats can be alleviated through a combination of technical and human controls and the positive (and often intended) influences of these controls.

To address this research conflict, this study uses an interpretive grounded theory research approach to investigate the consequences of privacy safeguard enactment in medical practices, including whether it influences their ability to meet privacy requirements and whether workflows are impeded. Our central contribution is a theoretical framework, the unintended consequences of privacy safeguard enactment (UCPSE) framework, which explicates the process by which privacy safeguards are evaluated and subsequently bypassed and the resulting influence on organisational compliance. The UCPSE highlights the importance of the imbalance challenge, which is the result of unintended consequences outweighing the intended consequences of privacy safeguard enactment. Failure to address the imbalance challenge leads to the adoption of workarounds that may ultimately harm the organisation’s privacy compliance. Despite several research calls, the consequences and effectiveness of organisational privacy efforts are largely missing from both information systems and health informatics research. This study is one of the first attempts to both systematically identify the impacts of privacy safeguard enactment and to examine its implications for privacy compliance in the healthcare domain.

We ground the approach firmly in communication theory and build on practices from agile software development.

We do so in the context of online opinion sharing. We propose that the unique design features of mobile computing devices and the intention and purpose of their users, meld into a technology affordance we label: Triggered essential reviewing. We empirically investigate the effect of this technology affordance on opinion characteristics (i.e., timing and length), and outcomes (i.e., opinion valence and content). We find that triggered essential reviewing engenders opinions that cover a narrower range of aspects of the experience and that it produces a negative evaluative bias—a bias that mitigates over time. Our work makes two contributions to the application of affordance theory in Information Systems. First, it shows the importance of IT design in studying experiential computing. While not taking a deterministic view of technology, we validate the notion that different technology designs produce a variation of effects around a predictable central tendency. Second, it empirically demonstrates that the affordances of embodied digital experiences have an effect on actual behavior as well as on the outcome of the experience itself.","['technology affordance', 'mobile devices', 'user-generated content', 'opinion platforms']",Gabriele Piccoli,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Piccoli%2C+Gabriele,"Louisiana State University Rm 2217 Business Education Complex, Nicholson Drive Extension 70803Baton RougeLAUSA

We further posited that certain psychological factors (i.e., framing and perceived control) would moderate the effect of the messenger-recipient relationship on the deaf effect. To test these ideas, we conducted two experiments. When messengers were seen as collaborative partners, recipients assigned more relevance to the risk warning and perceived a higher risk, making them less willing to continue the project. Framing the outcomes associated with redirecting or continuing the project in terms of losses (rather than gains) weakened this effect.

Synthesizing the extant literature on information management and information orientation, we further conceptualize PIMM as having four sub-dimensions of proactiveness, sharing, transparency, and formality, and PIMC as possessing five sub-dimensions of sensing, collecting, organizing, processing, and maintaining. Moreover, we develop a theoretical model that positions PIME as a mediator between two selected individual characteristics (IT self-efficacy and need-for-cognition) and job performance. New measures for PIME dimensions were developed and shown to have strong psychometric properties. The proposed model was empirically tested using data collected from 352 knowledge workers. As theorized, PIME was found to have significant effects on job performance (41%) and fully mediate the effects that the selected individual characteristics have on job performance. Responding to recent calls for advanced research on personal information management, the measures of PIMM and PIMC developed in this study have practical value as research and diagnostic tools and the findings provide useful insights to help organizations improve knowledge workers’ information management practices.","['personal information management effectiveness', 'knowledge management', 'questionnaire survey', 'need-for-cognition', 'self-efficacy', 'job performance']",Yujong Hwang,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Hwang%2C+Yujong,"School of Accountancy and MIS, Driehause College of Business, DePaul UniversityChicagoILU.S.A.;College of International Studies, Kyung Hee UniversityYonginRepublic of Korea

We explain why this shift should help researchers as they engage in the knowledge generation process.","['theory', 'methodology', 'process', 'variance', 'system', 'epistemology']",Pär J Ågerfalk,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/%C3%85gerfalk%2C+P%C3%A4r+J,"Department of Informatics and MediaUppsala UniversityUppsalaSweden

Much has transpired in the quarter of a century since its publication, which provides us with new sources of understanding about paradigms and how they relate to the challenges faced by the IS field. On the basis of the hermeneutical principles of tradition, prejudice, temporal distance, history of effect and application, this study describes the context from which B&L was written, its dependence on Whitley’s (1984) The Intellectual and Social Organization of the Sciences, and examines several of its claims and assertions. In contrast to B&L, this study finds the Kuhnian model of scientific progress well suited for a multidisciplinary and pluralistic field like IS and concludes with guidelines on how to reclaim the more transformative aspects of the paradigm concept, engender a culture of contextual borrowing from reference disciplines, and encourage conceptual development and autonomous theory construction.","['information systems (IS) disciplinarity', 'IS theory', 'IS philosophy', 'hermeneutics', 'Kuhnian paradigms and normal science', 'sociology of science and knowledge.']",Nik R Hassan,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Hassan%2C+Nik+R,"University of Minnesota DuluthDuluthMNU.S.A.

We investigate this question using data from 165 hotels affiliated with two brands of an international lodging chain. We study the effect of successful use and unreliability of an incremental IT-enabled self-service channel on overall CP. We find that the effect of the incremental service channel depends on the firm’s organizational resources. We also show that different organizations experience significantly different use and unreliability rates. Further, we find that the positive association between the use of an IT-enabled self-service channel and CP endures over a 2-year period, despite competitors’ widespread adoption of the technology enabling the incremental service channel (self-service kiosks). Our findings corroborate research on the strategic role of IT resources when appropriately coupled with complementary resources. They lead us to question the notion that IT is a strategic commodity. Indeed, the findings suggest that IT-dependent strategic initiatives have the potential to generate sustained CP, even when the technology that enables them appears ‘simple’.

However, while technology becomes more and more pervasive, an age-related underutilisation of IT remains observable. For instance, elderly people (65 years of age and older) are significantly less likely to use the Internet than the average population (see, for instance, European Commission, 2011). This age-related digital divide prevents many elderly people from using IT to enhance their quality of life through tools, such as Internet-based service delivery. Despite the significance of this phenomenon, the information systems (IS) literature lacks a comprehensive consideration and explanation of technology acceptance in general and more specifically, Internet adoption by the elderly. This paper thus studies the intentions of the elderly with regard to Internet use and identifies important influencing factors. Four alternative models based on technology acceptance theory are tested in the context of comprehensive survey data. As a result, a model that explains as much as 84% of the variance in technology adoption among the elderly is developed.

We present and analyse empirical data from a case in which electronic ordering in the Australian pharmaceutical industry evolved over a 30-year period from closed to quasi-open systems. We analyse this revelatory case using a practice-theoretical framework to make visible the phenomenon of IOIS evolution. An essential characteristic of this framework is the distinction between and symmetrical treatment of material, normative and ideational structures within the practices that constitute the IOIS. Against the findings of this case study, we then evaluate two promising models of long-term IS change, namely Porra's (1999) Colonial Systems model and Lyytinen and Newman's (2008) Punctuated Socio-technical IS Change model. These models are selected as highly elaborated IS exemplars of two classes of theories of organizational change, namely evolutionary and dialectical theories. We find that these two models can only partially explain our findings. Finally, we make suggestions for developing more comprehensive theoretical models within these two classes of IS change theories. In practical terms, our paper shows that the transformation from closed to open IOIS may require adoption of longer time frames than are usually assumed and closer attention to norms and rationales usually neglected in IS projects.","['inter-organizational information systems (IOIS)', 'systems evolution', 'long-term IS change', 'Colonial Systems model', 'Punctuated Socio-technical IS Change model', 'practice theory']",Stefan Klein,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Klein%2C+Stefan,"School of Business and Economics, University of MünsterMünsterGermany

While content validity is often performed rigorously, validated survey instruments may still lack contextual relevance and be out of touch with practice. We argue that IS behavioral research can improve its practical relevance without loss of rigor by carefully addressing a number of contextual issues in instrumentation design. In this opinion article, we outline five guidelines – relating to both rigor and relevance – designed to increase the contextual relevance of field survey research, using case examples from the area of IS security. They are: (1) inform study respondents that a behavior is an ISP violation, (2) measure specific examples of ISP violations, (3) ensure that ISP violations are important ISP problems in practice, (4) ensure the applicability of IS security violations to the organizational context, and (5) consider the appropriate level of specificity and generalizability for instrumentation. We review previous behavioral research on IS security and show that no existing study meets more than three of these five guidelines.

The search for consensus among executivesâ€™ perceptions of IT business value,Issue 3,"Volume 23, 2014 - Issue 3","Since firms rarely collect data on the precise economic or financial impacts of information technology (IT), perceptions play a key role in assessing IT impacts. To the extent that executives in the same firm evaluate IT impacts similarly, it can be easier to approve future IT investments or to initiate corrective action for failing IT investments. In this study, we use distributed sensemaking theory to investigate the conditions under which executives will reach a consensus as to the extent and locus of firm and process-level IT impacts in their firm. Using data from surveys of 133 top-level business executives in 13 firms, we show that consensus is a function of CIO-led sensegiving in the form of IT promotion, CIO leadership, information systems (IS) engagement with end users, and IS-business communications. The absence of consensus – discord – suggests IS disengagement, a lack of effective CIO leadership, weak IT-business communications, and ineffective promotion of the role of IT. Sensegiving does not mean telling executives what to think about IT but rather how to think about IT and its impacts at various points within the firm. Whether IT impacts are rated high or low, efforts to create increased consensus among executives can greatly enhance value from IT.","['executive perceptions', 'sensemaking', 'sensegiving', 'consensus', 'IT impacts', 'binary logit regression']",Paul P Tallon,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Tallon%2C+Paul+P,"Information Systems and Operations Management, Sellinger School of Business and Management, Loyola UniversityBaltimoreMDUSA

Walsham's paper, along with his further work, represents a cornerstone of the discourse surrounding interpretive research. It has set the tone for further publications in the area and has more recently been followed up by a detailed practical account of how to undertake interpretive research by the same author. Using Walsham's position as a starting point, the present paper questions some basic assumptions of interpretivism. Drawing on the philosophical background of interpretivism in hermeneutics and phenomenology, the paper questions the status of empirical research in the interpretivist tradition. Using quality criteria of different research streams related to interpretivism, the paper compares the role of empirical data in different types of research accounts with fairy tales, noting that interpretive IS research shares at least as many quality features with fairy tales as with positivist narratives. The paper concludes by discussing which consequences this position has for interpretive and other research in IS.","['interpretivism', 'critical theory', 'hermeneutics', 'phenomenology', 'empiricism', 'fairy tales']",Bernd Carsten Stahl,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Stahl%2C+Bernd+Carsten,"Department of Informatics, De Montfort University, UK

Stahl calls for a wider range and quantity of non-empirical approaches. I am broadly supportive of this call but, in this response, I also argue for the value of studies based on empirical data. In addition, I think that Stahl overstates his empiricist case somewhat and I identify a range of existing non-empirical genres of publication including theoretical papers, literature reviews, polemics and future-oriented speculations. However, I do like the idea of extending non-empirical approaches and I suggest some ideas for the future including short stories and novels, plays and artistic comparisons. I end with a brief discussion of the feasibility of such ideas bearing in mind the politics of academic publishing.","['IS field', 'interpretive research', 'empirical studies', 'non-emprical approaches', 'academic publishing']",Geoff Walsham,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Walsham%2C+Geoff,"Cambridge University, Judge Business School, Cambridge, UK

This article aims to deepen understanding of the processes by which technology and identity co-evolve in the IT assimilation process over time. The proposed alternative framework relies on the philosophy of Michel Foucault, applied to a longitudinal, qualitative case study of a French company involved in the deployment of a geolocation technology. The analysis reveals diverse patterns of interaction among the managerial discourses used to shape technicians' ascribed identity and the identity that technicians design for themselves, which then result in distinct IT assimilation types that contribute to the further evolution of their identity.","['identity', 'technology', 'assimilation', 'identification', 'discourse', 'Michel Foucault']",Aurélie Leclercq-Vandelannoitte,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Leclercq-Vandelannoitte%2C+Aur%C3%A9lie,"IESEG School of Management, Lille, France

The empirical basis of this work comes from case studies of integrated criminal justice information systems (IJIS). IJIS are organizational and technological ensembles created to facilitate inter-organizational information sharing among criminal justice agencies. The focus of these case studies was to examine how organizational identity shapes organizational ICT. This research found that organizational identity shapes an organization's ICT-related processes and is reflected in the material configurations of an organization's ICT; and that organizations with different identities exhibit those differences in their ICT. Three implications of this research are that organizational identity serves as both an enabler and constraint on organizational ICT development; organizational identity commitments will likely serve as a barrier to large-scale integration of different organizations' systems; organizational identity is relatively static and difficult to change.,"['green is', 'organisational & inter-organisational initiatives', 'social/organisational aspects of is']",Michael Tyworth,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Tyworth%2C+Michael,"Penn State University Park, U.S.A.

A key grammatical construct of such grammars is known as a Gateway. A Gateway construct is used to describe scenarios in which the workflow of a process diverges or converges according to relevant conditions. Gateway constructs have been subjected to much academic discussion about their meaning, role and usefulness, and have been linked to both process-modeling errors and process-model understandability. This paper examines perceptual discriminability effects of Gateway constructs on an individual's abilities to interpret process models. We compare two ways of expressing two convergence and divergence patterns – Parallel Split and Simple Merge – implemented in a process modeling grammar. On the basis of an experiment with 98 students, we provide empirical evidence that Gateway constructs aid the interpretation of process models due to a perceptual discriminability effect, especially when models are complex. We discuss the emerging implications for research and practice, in terms of revisions to grammar specifications, guideline development and design choices in process modeling.","['process modeling', 'visual expressiveness', 'process model comprehension', 'Gateway constructs']",Jan Recker,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Recker%2C+Jan,"Queensland University of TechnologyQLDAustralia

Many networks govern through an infomediary (i.e., electronic broker) that brings together disparate member organizations. These networks can resemble an enterprise where standards and incentives for use are imposed on its partners. This study seeks to extend an enterprise IT governance (ITG) concept to the U.S. e-prescribing network as it transitions from a paper-based network to a computer-mediated one. The operating model, proposed by Ross et al (2006), emphasizes choices in standardization and integration to align strategy with operational processes to improve enterprise performance. Missing in their work is evidence that macro-level choices embedded in the operating model directly impact network workflow. A comparative synthesis traces the changes made to the U.S. e-prescribing operating model to their impact upon the roles and relationships among network members. Some workflow mis-alignments were traceable to the operating philosophy imposed by healthcare policy-makers. The study suggests IT alignment in networks may be better achieved through governing operating models rather than the traditional ITG focus on organizational forms.","['healthcare information systems', 'IT governance', 'system design', 'operating model', 'inter-organizational network', 'workflow']",Nelson King,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/King%2C+Nelson,"Business Information & Decision Systems, Olayan School of Business, American University of BeirutBeirutLebanon

Importantly, as business users continually gain experience with enterprise systems and a new generation of tech-savvy workers enters the labour force, IT competence is increasingly distributed beyond the IS department. Despite its strategic potential however, IT competence residing within the functional areas of the firm is essentially untapped until it is volunteered by functional area knowledge workers. Addressing the changing landscape of IT competence across the enterprise, the current study examines factors that drive business professionals to volunteer their IT competences to the firm. This research introduces the concept of IT competence volunteering, which is conceptualized as a form of organizational citizenship behaviour that is not explicitly contracted by the firm and may not be directly rewarded. Guided by social exchange theory, a multi-foci model is introduced that positions IT competence as well as workplace exchange relationships as antecedents of IT competence volunteering intention. Overall, the study's results empirically demonstrate the important impacts that user-IS department exchange and perceived organizational support have on the business professional's intention to volunteer his/her IT competence to the firm.","['IT competence', 'social exchange theory', 'organizational citizenship behaviour', 'perceived organizational support', 'user-IS department exchange', 'IT human capital']",Joshua M Davis,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Davis%2C+Joshua+M,"Department of Marketing and Supply Chain ManagementSchool of Business, College of CharlestonCharlestonSCU.S.A.

Although it is empirically clear that seller reviews (volume and valence) and product price contribute to buyers’ willingness-to-pay (WTP) differently across various studies, it is theoretically less understood why such effects qualitatively differ (e.g., positive vs negative), rendering unclear managerial implications for online marketers. In this paper, we study the role of online seller reviews and product price in buyers’ WTP. We offer a conceptual framework from a risk perspective in which we argue that the different effects of seller reviews and product price on buyers’ WTP may emerge simultaneously in an online market. We highlight two important drivers for such qualitatively different effects: a difference in buyers’ risk attitudes (averse, neutral, or seeking) and a difference in WTP measures (absolute or relative). We test our hypotheses and find good support for them both internally (an experimental study) and externally (an empirical study).

Typically, there have developed implicit or explicit assumptions that top management support has to be constant and consistent during the entire life of an IS implementation project. However, previous research investigating this issue has been based mainly on a ‘single project’ perspective, although contemporary organisational settings have increasingly involved many projects taking place simultaneously. Such multiple-project environments bring into question the feasibility of the previous assumptions and invite revisiting them. This paper aims to do this by examining the materialisation of top management support in a multiple-project environment. To this end, it investigates the interactions between a project to implement an Enterprise Resource Planning system and other projects and programmes in a prominent international organisation. It applies a framework from Actor Network Theory to explore the different aspects of what is involved in being in a multiple-project environment and the nature of the materialisation of top management support. The findings unravel some of the complexity surrounding top management support in this contemporary organisational setting. Some important implications for theory and practice are highlighted and discussed.","['IS project management', 'top management support', 'multiple projects', 'qualitative case study', 'Actor Network Theory']",Amany Elbanna,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Elbanna%2C+Amany,"Royal Holloway University of LondonSurreyU.K.

While the vast majority of research papers on IS business value find empirical evidence in favour of both the operational and strategic relevance of IS, the fundamental question of the causal relationship between IS investments and business value remains partly unexplained. Three research tasks are essential requisites on the path towards addressing this epistemological question: the synthesis of existing knowledge, the identification of a lack of knowledge and the proposition of paths for closing the knowledge gaps. This paper considers each of these tasks. Research findings include that correlations between IS investments and productivity vary widely among companies and that the mismeasurement of IS investment impact may be rooted in delayed effects. Key limitations of current research are based on the ambiguity and fuzziness of IS business value, the neglected disaggregation of IS investments, and the unexplained process of creating internal and competitive value. Addressing the limitations we suggest research paths, such as the identification of synergy opportunities of IS assets, and the explanation of relationships between IS innovation and change in IS capabilities.","['IS business value', 'IS research framework', 'IS impact', 'IS value', 'research agenda', 'literature review']",Guido Schryen,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Schryen%2C+Guido,"Institute of Management Information Systems, University of RegensburgRegensburgGermany

Effective management of IT infrastructure investments includes identification of embedded growth options in the infrastructure, and exercising them in a timely manner. Extant research has recognized that while managers could use real options thinking in IT investment management, managerial bias could affect the timing of option exercise and their realized value. We analyze the effect of time-inconsistent preferences of present-biased managers on the exercise time of real growth options and the realized value using a discrete time option valuation model. The results show that present-biased managers are more likely to exercise options early when the net payoffs are low, the option payoffs have high volatility, and the risk free discount rate is small. In addition, present biased managers are more likely to exercise a growth option early in its life when the project is performing well. We provide implications for practice and IT governance.","['IT investments', 'IT Infrastructure', 'real options', 'growth options', 'time preferences', 'present biased preferences']",Ram L Kumar,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Kumar%2C+Ram+L,"Belk College of Business, UNC CharlotteCharlotteNCU.S.A.

The study presents an original longitudinal study of project member experiences. In this paper, we have described and analysed one core category, project power, which was derived from a grounded theory (GT) study. This study extends existing theories about power in organisational contexts, in particular the everyday use of power in projects. The paper shows how GT can be used to gain significant insights into a case study, and also generate new concepts. This paper gives detailed insights into the power issues as they played out in a complex IOIS project. This IOIS project spanned four user organisations, two suppliers, one national organisation, a research organisation and a government Ministry. One key finding is that, given the complexity of the project management structures in an IOIS project such as this, project members often resorted to formal authority as a means of getting things done, in the absence of informal links between organisations.

The study presents an original longitudinal study of project member experiences. In this paper, we have described and analysed one core category, project power, which was derived from a grounded theory (GT) study. This study extends existing theories about power in organisational contexts, in particular the everyday use of power in projects. The paper shows how GT can be used to gain significant insights into a case study, and also generate new concepts. This paper gives detailed insights into the power issues as they played out in a complex IOIS project. This IOIS project spanned four user organisations, two suppliers, one national organisation, a research organisation and a government Ministry. One key finding is that, given the complexity of the project management structures in an IOIS project such as this, project members often resorted to formal authority as a means of getting things done, in the absence of informal links between organisations. The project history also had major ramifications on the use of power in this project.","['power', 'IOIS projects', 'grounded theory']",Cathy Urquhart,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Urquhart%2C+Cathy,"Manchester Metropolitan University

Survey data collected from 250 online auction participants were used to test the model using partial least squares analysis. SC and CE were found to have significant impacts on OB that were either partially or fully mediated by WCB.

Recent surveys indicate that while many organizations severely restrict or ban SNSs (i.e., Facebook and Twitter) at work, a large majority are actively using, or evaluating the use of SNSs. The purpose of this study is to investigate the implementation of an internal SNS designed to help a large financial institution's IT new hire program.

We rely on several theoretical mechanisms and, consistent with previous studies, suggest that enjoyment can lead to presumably positive outcomes, such as high engagement. Nevertheless, it can also facilitate the development of a strong habit and reinforce it until it becomes a ‘bad habit’, that can help forming a strong pathological and maladaptive psychological dependency on the use of the IT artifact (i.e., technology addiction).

The model was tested by measuring students’ perceptions, who participated in an experimental study that required them to use a GCP for collaboratively planning a trip. Students used Yahoo! Trip Planner (Y!TP) for forming groups and then for identifying, selecting and discussing the inclusion and scheduling of geo-referenced travel activities, places and itineraries on the top of a map. The findings confirmed the multidimensionality of the Y!TP's impact on collaborative decision making, but the respondents gave a greater importance to the process (i.e. effectiveness and community building) rather than the outcome impacts (efficiency and results) of Y!TP. Specifically, the findings show that GCP can effectively support and foster teamwork, when GCP are designed to scaffold the group tasks, manage group intelligence, as well as facilitate and nurture group communication and bonding processes. The outcome impacts of GCP related to both qualitative (e.g. group consensus) and quantitative items (e.g. time and effort savings). Finally, the study discusses the implications of the findings on further investigating the functionality and effectiveness of GCP.","['geocollaborative portals', 'GIS', 'web 2.0', 'collaboration', 'group decision making', 'impact', 'trip planning']",Marianna Sigala,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Sigala%2C+Marianna,"Department of Business AdministrationUniversity of the AegeanChiosGreece

This study examines the role of free comments given in a commercial information service through the lens of the expectation-confirmation theory and continuance. Data from a question and answer web site are analyzed by structural equations modeling to test the theoretical model whereby customer satisfaction is key to continuance and is predicted largely by social interaction that takes place on the site. The model is supported by the field data retrieved from the site. The data show that people came with equal expectations, received equal service, and continued to use the system if they were satisfied with it. Satisfaction was predicted by conversation. Free activity emerges as an integral part of the service in a fee-based information market, improving satisfaction and continuance, and thereby leading to measurable outcomes for the commercial owners of the site. The findings, based on unobtrusive field data rather than self-report questionnaires, extend expectation confirmation theory by adding a social dimension to it.","['information markets', 'incentives for participation', 'expectation-confirmation theory', 'satisfaction', 'continuance']",Raban Daphne Ruth,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Ruth%2C+Raban+Daphne,"University of HaifaHaifaIsrael

However, before adopting this technology, managers need to be able to identify its direct and indirect benefits. These benefits are expected to be significant and have begun to be studied empirically and analytically in narrow, isolated segments (e.g., supply chain management). In this paper, we focus on applications of RFID in the retail sector, specifically in store operations. We have adapted the balanced scorecard (BSC) model as a decision-making framework to build a holistic model of RFID-enabled changes throughout retail store operations including marketing, merchandising, and supply chain management. After reviewing the existing literature, we conducted a Delphi study in which 10 consultants and senior managers from leading U.S. retailers were interviewed. The results indicate that benefits in the areas of merchandising and marketing may not be realized as directly as those in the supply chain, but their effects should not be underestimated.

Our analysis of the gap between those who merely register to join a virtual world and those who ultimately engage the community on a regular basis derives from a lack of assimilation.

After discussing and integrating these three classes of factors, we test our model through a study of 223 new users of Second Life.

This is so despite the diversity of research methods available, the emergence of an interpretivist tradition, and some isolated examples of methodological pluralism. While there have been significant contributions in guiding qualitative research methods teaching, little research has been undertaken that considers the training actually provided, and the possible impacts this may have on the quality and quantity of qualitative research articles in our journals. This explorative study aims to provide some insight into what training is provided, the issues confronted, and possible impediments to publishing qualitative research. Data were collected from interviews with a panel of international colleagues who have a range of experience in teaching and applying qualitative methods. Grounded Theory is used to identify emergent and interconnected themes. Experiential and social learning lenses are used to reflect on the results, providing some initial understanding of the complexities of teaching and undertaking qualitative research. Theoretical as well as practical contributions are made regarding the means by which qualitative research may be introduced, developed and extended within the IS academy, and further theorisation of social and experiential learning.","['Teaching qualitative research', 'grounded theory', 'social learning theory', 'experiential learning theory', 'tacit knowledge transfer', 'international perspectives']",Robert D Galliers,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Galliers%2C+Robert+D,"Bentley UniversityMassachusettsU.S.A.

This is so despite the diversity of research methods available, the emergence of an interpretivist tradition, and some isolated examples of methodological pluralism. While there have been significant contributions in guiding qualitative research methods teaching, little research has been undertaken that considers the training actually provided, and the possible impacts this may have on the quality and quantity of qualitative research articles in our journals. This explorative study aims to provide some insight into what training is provided, the issues confronted, and possible impediments to publishing qualitative research. Data were collected from interviews with a panel of international colleagues who have a range of experience in teaching and applying qualitative methods. Grounded Theory is used to identify emergent and interconnected themes. Experiential and social learning lenses are used to reflect on the results, providing some initial understanding of the complexities of teaching and undertaking qualitative research. Theoretical as well as practical contributions are made regarding the means by which qualitative research may be introduced, developed and extended within the IS academy, and further theorisation of social and experiential learning.","['Teaching qualitative research', 'grounded theory', 'social learning theory', 'experiential learning theory', 'tacit knowledge transfer', 'international perspectives']",Jimmy C Huang,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Huang%2C+Jimmy+C,"Warwick Business School, The University of WarwickU.K.

Besides critical research and sometimes positivism, qualitative research in information systems can be performed following a paradigm of pragmatism. This paradigm is associated with action, intervention and constructive knowledge. This paper has picked out interpretivism and pragmatism as two possible and important research paradigms for qualitative research in information systems. It clarifies each paradigm in an ideal-typical fashion and then conducts a comparison revealing commonalities and differences. It is stated that a qualitative researcher must either adopt an interpretive stance aiming towards an understanding that is appreciated for being interesting; or a pragmatist stance aiming for constructive knowledge that is appreciated for being useful in action. The possibilities of combining pragmatism and interpretivism in qualitative research in information systems are analysed. A research case (conducted through action research (AR) and design research (DR)) that combines interpretivism and pragmatism is used as an illustration. It is stated in the paper that pragmatism has influenced IS research to a fairly large extent, albeit in a rather implicit way. The paradigmatic foundations are seldom known and explicated. This paper contributes to a further clarification of pragmatism as an explicit research paradigm for qualitative research in information systems. Pragmatism is considered an appropriate paradigm for AR and DR.","['qualitative research', 'interpretivism', 'pragmatism', 'paradigm', 'information systems']",Göran Goldkuhl,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Goldkuhl%2C+G%C3%B6ran,"Linköping UniversityLinköpingSweden;Stockholm UniversityKistaSweden

However, insufficient attention has been spent on understanding the unique validity and reliability issues related to the timeline that is either explicitly or implicitly required in a longitudinal case study. In this paper, we address three forms of longitudinal timeline validity: time unit validity (which deals with the question of how to segment the timeline – weeks, months, years, etc.), time boundaries validity (which deals with the question of how long the timeline should be), and time period validity (which deals with the issue of which periods should be in the timeline). We also examine timeline reliability, which deals with the question of whether another judge would have assigned the same events to the same sequence, categories, and periods. Techniques to address these forms of longitudinal timeline validity include: matching the unit of time to the pace of change to address time unit validity, use of member checks and formal case study protocol to address time boundaries validity, analysis of archival data to address both time unit and time boundary validity, and the use of triangulation to address timeline reliability.

Various forms of qualitative analysis of the content of these data exist and have revealed important insights. Yet, to date, these analyses have been hampered by limitations of human coding of large data sets, and by bias due to human interpretation. In this paper, we compare and combine two quantitative analysis techniques to demonstrate the capabilities of computational analysis for content analysis of unstructured text. Specifically, we seek to demonstrate how two quantitative analytic methods, viz., Latent Semantic Analysis and data mining, can aid researchers in revealing core content topic areas in large (or small) data sets, and in visualizing how these concepts evolve, migrate, converge or diverge over time. We exemplify the complementary application of these techniques through an examination of a 25-year sample of abstracts from selected journals in Information Systems, Management, and Accounting disciplines.

Yet, this fact has not been integrated into existing analyses, and its implications have not been fully developed. We propose that IOIS scholars need to look beyond the single adopting organization in IOIS adoption studies and in contrast consider adoption units what we call an adoption configuration. Each such configuration can be further characterized along the following dimensions: (1) vision, (2) key functionality, (3) mode of interaction, (4) structure and (5) mode of appropriation. In addition, these dimensions do not co-vary independently. For example, a particular organizing vision assumes a specific inter-organizational structure. A typology of IOIS configurations for adoption analysis is laid out consisting of dyadic, hub and spoke, industry and community configurations.

With the advent of open-source and on-demand solutions, new models for developing and distributing software have entered the stage providing IS managers with more options in AS selection. On the basis of an Analytic Hierarchy Process model, we propose a framework including software package and implementation attributes on different hierarchy levels to examine how IS managers evaluate the relative fulfilment of key selection criteria by traditional, open-source, and on-demand office suites. By testing the framework with a random sample of 254 IS managers of 166 smaller and 88 mid-sized/larger firms, we validate its validity and usefulness in evaluating different software delivery models. Our empirical results show that open-source office suites were consistently perceived to be superior in meeting ease of customization (i.e., extensibility and adaptability) and cost criteria (i.e., acquisition and maintenance cost), whereas traditional software models were superior in fulfilling functionality, ease of use, and support requirements. On-demand office suites excelled in the fulfilment of time-to-value and data recoverability. We discuss further results of the comparison of the three software models, and derive practical and research implications for office suite selection.","['office suite selection', 'evaluation criteria', 'software models', 'open-source', 'on-demand', 'Analytic Hierarchy Process']",Alexander Benlian,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Benlian%2C+Alexander,"Institute for Information Systems and New Media, University of Munich, Munich School of Business Ludwigstr. 28 80539MunichGermany

National culture theory based on the GLOBE study suggests that culture affects the coping with such change in China and the United States, but does not cogently suggest that coping mechanisms differ in effectiveness across the two cultures. Analysis of data from 71 IT executives and managers in China and 246 in the United States suggests that Chinese IT organizations employ coping mechanisms of vendor support, education and training, and internal procedures more extensively than do U.S. IT organizations. IT organizations in both countries apply education and training as well as internal procedures to successfully deal with the problems of rapid IT change. Vendor support additionally predicted success in Chinese but not U.S. organizations, whereas in both U.S. and Chinese organizations endurance predicted lack of success. The research thus extends national culture theory by proposing that culture affects successful coping. Implications for research suggest the identification of actions to overcome the impact of cultural differences. Implications for practice suggest that multinational corporations deal with rapid IT change differently in divisions in different cultures, regardless of whether in China, the United States, Europe, or elsewhere.","['coping mechanisms for rapid information technology change', 'national culture', 'rapid information technology change']",Xiang Fang,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Fang%2C+Xiang,"Department of Decision Sciences and MISFarmer School of Business, Miami UniversityU.S.A.

Using a case study of three firms’ use of Kmaps in their Human Resource departments and drawing upon Bourdieu's social theory, illusion of control theory, and IS as signal and symbol theory, our study provides a critical perspective on the use of Kmaps by groups of actors to reinforce their social domination in business organizations.

Interpretational confounding, the disparity in the nominal and empirical meaning of a formatively measured construct, is at the center stage of the concern. Our study examines the issue in the context of the higher-order abstraction, focusing on the formatively defined relationship between the second-order construct and its indicators (i.e., first-order latent variables). Although the second-order formative abstraction is a widely accepted practice in structural equation modeling, the estimation results have been given a blind faith with no attempt to evaluate their integrity. Our empirical test, therefore, constitutes an attempt to fill the void. This study observed moderations of the theoretical relationship between reflectively designed first-order constructs and formatively defined second-order constructs when there is a change of endogenous variables. For this, two different formatively defined second-order constructs (i.e., IT management capabilities and IT personnel expertise) are utilized for the empirical testing. The estimation reveals that, while there was a considerable moderation of weights between IT management capabilities and its first-order constructs, those between IT personnel expertise and its first-order constructs remained relatively stable. These results demonstrate that the formatively defined relationship between the first- and second-order constructs can be precarious depending on the choice of the dependent variables. The analysis, therefore, revealed a significant presence of interpretational confounding and a higher chance of Type 1 error in model estimation. This implies that it becomes difficult to retain the construct validity and external validity of a formatively defined second-order construct. Thus, researchers are encouraged to exercise caution in mobilizing the formatively defined second-order measurement.","['structural equation modeling', 'formative measurement', 'formative indicator', 'second-order construct', 'interpretational confounding', 'construct validity']",Bongsik Shin,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Shin%2C+Bongsik,"Information and Decision Systems, San Diego State UniversityU.S.A.

We relate these writing norms to historical imprints of management and business studies, in particular: enigma-focused rhetorics, interest in institutionalized literature, neglect for managerially grounded rhetoric and lack of reflexivity in scientific writing. We explain this relation as a quest for academic legitimacy. Lastly, some suggestions are offered to address the discrepancies between these writing norms and more recent epistemological and theoretical stances adopted by IS researchers.","['argumentative strategies', 'history', 'academic writing', 'legitimacy']",Michael D Myers,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Myers%2C+Michael+D,View further author information,

While some research methods are closely related to the positivist research paradigm (experiments, surveys, and structural equation modelling) and others to the interpretivist paradigm (field study, ethnography, and action research), the critical paradigm is not identified with specific ‘critical methods’ and typically relies on the appropriation of interpretivist methods (such as critical ethnography). The criticism of the critical research paradigm in IS has often focused on the lack of distinctly critical research methods and even the neglect of methodological issues (Klein; McGrath). This paper questions the notion of and the arguments behind the quest for ‘critical research methods’ defined in contrast to positivist and interpretivist methods. Instead, the paper argues that it is a critical research methodology – understood as an overall strategy of conceptualizing and conducting an inquiry, engaging with studied phenomena, and constructing and justifying socially relevant knowledge, which distinguishes critical from other research paradigms. Building on a Kleinian argument regarding the need for common principles across diverse critical IS inquiries (Klein; Myers & Klein) this paper proposes a framework that describes key dimensions of a critical research methodology that distinguish critical from other research paradigms and provide methodological guidance in the doing of critical research.","['IS research paradigms', 'critical IS research', 'critical concerns in information systems', 'critical research methodology']",Dubravka Cecez-Kecmanovic,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Cecez-Kecmanovic%2C+Dubravka,"School of Information Systems, Technology and Management, Australian School of Business, University of New South WalesAustralia

Foucauldian and Toulminian insights,Issue 4,"Volume 20, 2011 - Issue 4: Including a Special Section on Kleinian Approach to Information Systems Research","Following the Kleinian spirit, this study takes a critical view of the existing orthodoxy within information systems (IS) and reframes the ongoing discussion concerning the intellectual core, identity and disciplinary status of IS using the disciplinary analysis of Michel Foucault and Stephen Toulmin. Instead of limiting the discussion to specific paradigms, topics, subjects or content, it focuses on the characteristics, rules and goals of IS as an academic field. A disciplinary lens is used to frame what it means to be a field, discipline and science, and in the process the study uncovers four doxas that have shaped the development of the IS field: (1) the IS research community sees no difference between fields, disciplines or sciences; (2) IT changes so rapidly, and thus the IS field needs to change to remain relevant; (3) disciplines are by definition rigid, inflexible and uni-theoretical and (4) because IS is pluralistic, IS should not become a discipline. This study's analyses of the IS field's discursive formation and intellectual ideals offer novel perspectives that allow for the integration of the IS field's plurality and diversity. To transform the IS field from its multimodal existence into a vibrant, diverse, academically and socially relevant and influential discipline, the study proposes actionable strategies that include (1) agreeing on the intellectual ideals for IS, (2) focusing on conceptual formation, (3) focusing on theory construction, (4) erecting genealogical boundaries and (5) fostering the development of professional bodies.","['philosophy of science', 'information systems (IS) disciplinarity', 'IS theory', 'disciplinary theory', 'archaeology of knowledge', 'intellectual structure']",Nik R Hassan,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Hassan%2C+Nik+R,"University of Minnesota DuluthDuluthU.S.A.

Successful t-government is predicated on citizen adoption and usage of e-government services. The contribution of this research is to enhance our understanding of the factors associated with the usage of e-government services among members of a community on the unfortunate side of the divide. A questionnaire was administered to members, of a techno-disadvantaged public housing community and neighboring households, who partook in training or used the community computer lab. The results indicate that perceived access barriers and perceived ease of use (PEOU) are significantly associated with usage, while perceived usefulness (PU) is not. Among the demographic characteristics, educational level, employment status, and household income all have a significant impact on access barriers and employment is significantly associated with PEOU. Finally, PEOU is significantly related to PU. Overall, the results emphasize that t-government cannot cross the digital divide without accompanying employment programs and programs that enhance citizens’ ease in using such services.","['t-government', 'digital divide', 'technology acceptance model', 'TAM', 'e-government', 'taxonomy']",Janice C Sipior,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Sipior%2C+Janice+C,"School of Business, Villanova UniversityVillanovaPAU.S.A.

Successful t-government is predicated on citizen adoption and usage of e-government services. The contribution of this research is to enhance our understanding of the factors associated with the usage of e-government services among members of a community on the unfortunate side of the divide. A questionnaire was administered to members, of a techno-disadvantaged public housing community and neighboring households, who partook in training or used the community computer lab. The results indicate that perceived access barriers and perceived ease of use (PEOU) are significantly associated with usage, while perceived usefulness (PU) is not. Among the demographic characteristics, educational level, employment status, and household income all have a significant impact on access barriers and employment is significantly associated with PEOU. Finally, PEOU is significantly related to PU. Overall, the results emphasize that t-government cannot cross the digital divide without accompanying employment programs and programs that enhance citizens’ ease in using such services.","['t-government', 'digital divide', 'technology acceptance model', 'TAM', 'e-government', 'taxonomy']",Burke T Ward,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Ward%2C+Burke+T,"School of Business, Villanova UniversityVillanovaPAU.S.A.

Toward greater integration of insights from reductionistic and holistic approaches,Issue 1,"Volume 20, 2011 - Issue 1","After more than two decades of intensive research, researchers are still struggling to explain the strategic value of information technology (IT) capabilities. The current study suggests that sufficient advancement has not been made in this area of research because of the gap between the richness of theoretical formulations and the minimalism of the reductionistic approach taken to test them. While theoretical formulations describe complex relationships between IT capabilities and competitive advantage, reductionistic explanations rely on models that represent the integration of simple relationships. This area of research can, therefore, benefit from the wider adoption of a holistic approach that attributes competitive advantage to profiles of IT capabilities. This study draws on the resource-based view and configurational theory to develop two reductionistic (direct and mediation) and two holistic (gestalt and profile-deviation) models of IT strategic value. The four models are tested with data collected from IT managers. The empirical analysis illustrates the insights that can be gained by drawing on the relative strengths of reductionistic and holistic explanations of IT strategic value.","['IT strategic value', 'IT capabilities', 'competitive advantage', 'resource-based view', 'configurational theory']",Lior Fink,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Fink%2C+Lior,"Ben-Gurion University of the NegevBeer-ShevaIsrael

A key gap in the literature is lack of recognition that underlying this macro level of alignment are other, more granular levels of alignment involving the interdependent subunits within the corporate IT unit. Given the critical interdependencies between development and testing subunits in software engineering, this paper focuses on an alignment model for ensuring that these two functions work together effectively. A development-testing alignment (DTA) model is described, and a case study investigating its value and application is presented. This DTA is decomposed into distinct components for the purposes of theoretical clarity and pragmatic application. The case study analysis uses the model to understand and interpret development-testing alignment in a Fortune 500 company. We found that the development and testing functions were significantly misaligned, and our model identified close to twenty specific aspects that needed to be considered to enhance alignment. These included changes in specificity of scope, governance, resource availability, competencies, and processes. Our analysis shows that the DTA model can be usefully applied for the purpose of understanding tactical alignment between subunits within a corporate IT unit. It also demonstrates that there is value in considering alignment as a dynamic, context-driven, social phenomenon as well as a useful interpretative lens for exploring organizational interactions and interdependencies.","['software development', 'software testing', 'strategic alignment', 'case study']",Colin Onita,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Onita%2C+Colin,"University of MemphisTennesseeU.S.A.

The current study examines the role of technology enabled job learning as a key component in the complex relationship between information systems use and technology outcomes. Data from 308 end-users were analyzed to evaluate the relationships between system use and technology enabled job learning, and technology enabled job learning and technology outcomes. Technology enabled job learning was conceptualized in terms of how computer applications helped individuals learn and better perform their jobs. System use was conceptualized in terms of decision support, work integration, and customer service. Technology outcomes were conceptualized in terms of management control, task innovation, task productivity, and customer satisfaction. Results suggest that systems use has a significant, positive effect on job learning, and that job learning has a significant, positive effect on technology outcomes.

A modified version of the recently operationalized E-S-QUAL instrument is used to examine online service quality from the point of view of the citizens and tax practitioners who use this eGovernment system. The findings show that efficiency and ease of completion are the dimensions of website service quality that most influence ROS users’ perceptions of value and convenience as well as their intentions to use and recommend the website to their peers. The practical implications of these findings include the fact that providers of public sector e-services should concentrate on communicating the functionality of their e-services. In addition, they should focus on reducing citizen concerns regarding misuse or mismanagement of personal data.","['e-government', 'service quality', 'online taxation', 'E-S-QUAL', 'E-PUBLIC-SECTOR-QUAL']",Aideen Kearney,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Kearney%2C+Aideen,"Department of StatisticsTrinity CollegeIreland

Little research has been done on the way individual and group resistance emerges and evolves during prior stages of projects. This focus on pre-implementation phases is important since Information Systems (IS) managers need to anticipate potential conflicts and users’ resistance that can involve project failure. While IS literature has separately developed theories on resistance and conflicts, we conceptualise a whole theoretic-system we call ‘IT Conflict-Resistance Theory’ (IT-CRT). This theory is used as driver for a 2-year action research project conducted at Netia Corporation (a worldwide leader in video and audio broadcasting) during preliminary phases of its Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) implementation project. According to our findings, while conflicts toward IT implementation are often considered to have negative effects and require being actively managed by top managers, the case study delivers an alternative observation: a passive-like attitude of managers during the IT pre-implantation phase does not prevent the resolution of a socio-political oriented conflict between two groups of employees. Our observations illustrate how the avoidance management style invites team members to cope with conflict situations and to express tacit causes of resistance. While most Management Information System methods tend naturally to maximise users’ satisfaction and to reduce potential resistance, the IT-CRT theory developed in this article supports an alternative approach: enhancing resistance in order to anticipate and resolve latent conflicts that are directly or indirectly related to the project. The underlying message of this article for researchers and practitioners is to consider users’ resistance toward IT as a key process embedded into IT choices and IS design.","['resistance', 'conflicts', 'avoidance', 'pre-implementation', 'ERP']",Régis Meissonier,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Meissonier%2C+R%C3%A9gis,"CREGOR, Montpellier II UniversityFrance

We used structural equation modelling to empirically test these relationships. The findings showed that adopting IBIS indirectly improves the operational performance of firms through business process performance. The positive effect on financial performance of adopting IBIS is not direct, but through the mediating effects of operational performance and business process performance. We also utilised multiple group analysis to test some of the model relationships across firms using several organisational and environmental factors as moderators. The organisational factors tested are firm type, age and ownership type. The environmental factors consisted of dynamism, complexity and hostility. We found that the organisational factors are significant moderators and that complexity and hostility are not significant moderators. However, the effects of dynamism as a moderator are less clear.","['information technology', 'interorganisational systems', 'supply chain management', 'Internet', 'e-commerce', 'survey']",Ismail Sila,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Sila%2C+Ismail,"Department of Finance and Management ScienceEdwards School of Business, University of SaskatchewanSaskatoonCanada

A test of two competing hypotheses of IT innovation and environment alignment,Issue 5,"Volume 19, 2010 - Issue 5","When does it benefit a firm to take a lead in innovation with information technology (IT)? How should a firm align its IT innovation with a dynamic industry? In addressing these questions we present a typology of IT Innovation and Environment Alignment (ITIEA) based on a firm's IT innovation strategic orientation and the industry environment. The traditional ‘fit’ perspective predicts that a firm that matches its IT innovation with a dynamic environment would obtain performance benefits. In contrast, the ‘options’ perspective suggests that a firm that takes advantage of a stable environment to proactively pursue IT innovation and develop IT capability as real options would obtain performance advantage. We employ a quasi-experiment design to test these two competing hypotheses using archival data of IT leaders over a time frame of 6 years. We perform a longitudinal analysis of the performance change trajectories of proactive and reactive IT leaders over time. The results indicate a general support for the ‘options’ perspective that proactive IT leaders that lead in innovation with IT in relatively stable environments are found to consistently outperform reactive IT leaders in overall performance, allocative efficiency, and cost efficiency in management process. However, interestingly, the results also show a partial support for the ‘fit’ perspective that reactive IT leaders that emphasize intensive deployment of IT innovation in dynamic environments are found to obtain a cost advantage in production and operation process over time. The findings offer practical implications for managers to better engage in IT innovations to create and sustain competitive advantage. Synthesizing options thinking and dynamic capability perspective, we provide a framework to better understand IT innovation, dynamic environment, and performance outcomes.

The result is a pluralistic discipline that has triggered an ongoing debate about whether the ‘liquidity’ characteristic of IS is a natural consequence of rapidly changing technologies or if it is indicative of a chaotic state that is unsustainable. This paper looks at IS through a new and different lens by using the theory of the professions to gain insight into current and heretofore unidentified problems facing the discipline. Casting IS as a profession presents an integrated view of academic IS, IS practice and IS education grounded in a framework that explores connections among these three elements. The paper concludes with a discussion of the processes by which professions evolve and likely consequences for IS research, practice and education.","['IS identity', 'academic IS', 'professions', 'IS practice', 'IS education']",Mark John Somers,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Somers%2C+Mark+John,"School of Management, New Jersey Institute of Technology & Rutgers Business SchoolU.S.A.

To demonstrate the utility of this perspective, we deliberately consider a ‘strange’ case from a different time, space and culture. We discuss the nature of human organisation among the Inka Empire and how this organisation was reliant upon the enactment of significance, particularly in relation to an artefact known as the khipu. We conclude with a discussion of the value of our framework in helping us understand the complex entanglement of information, systems and technology within human organisation.","['activity systems', 'information systems', 'data systems', 'signs', 'sociotechnical', 'sociomaterial']",Paul Beynon-Davies,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Beynon-Davies%2C+Paul,"Cardiff Business School, Cardiff UniversityWales

We identify how these factors can be observed, and illustrate how the fit between strategic and contextual factors affects performance. We present our theory as hypotheses and provide the empirical indicators for the constituent constructs.","['electronic marketplace', 'performance', 'model']",Patrick Finnegan,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Finnegan%2C+Patrick,"The Australian School of Business, University of New South WalesSydneyAustralia

A study of shopbotsâ€™ vendor coverage strategy,Issue 3,"Volume 19, 2010 - Issue 3","Consumers often use shopbots to search for information when making purchase decisions in Internet markets. Although they have varying sensitivity to shopbot bias, consumers generally prefer accurate market representation. However, in choosing the accuracy of market representation, shopbots must balance the desires of consumers with the costs of providing their services and with the desires of the vendors, who are often the largest source of their revenue. In this paper, we study how accurately shopbots represent a market and analyze the strategies shopbots adopt to achieve market representativeness. We theoretically identify two important drivers in shopbot vendor coverage strategy – how many vendors it covers (shopbot size) and which vendors it covers (shopbot affiliation) – and analytically show how the drivers affect shopbot market representativeness. We report the results of a large-scale study in which we collected 2.2 million vendor price listings from eight shopbots and develop metrics for measuring shopbot size, shopbot affiliation, and shopbot market representativeness. We found that (1) shopbots do not represent markets equally well; (2) size drives a shopbot's market representativeness positively whereas affiliation drives a shopbot's market representativeness negatively; (3) shopbots follow differnet vendor representative strategies to pursue market representativeness.","['electronic markets', 'shopbots', 'market representativeness', 'vendor coverage strategy']",Gove Allen,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Allen%2C+Gove,"Brigham Young UniversityU.S.A.

This represents a case of extreme information systems development (ISD) failure en masse, where all but two of the 22 projects in a business unit went over budget, causing senior executives to refocus their strategic priorities and cancel all current and potential projects that followed. This study focuses specifically on the two best performing (12 and 4% under budget) and worst performing (223 and 320% over budget) of these projects. Using a framework drawn from control systems theory, this study examines the ‘tightness’ of budgetary control exerted over each project, and what was done or could have been done to avert such failure. The study then identifies a set of emerging factors affecting tight budgetary control in ISD.","['budgeting', 'system development', 'control', 'project management']",Kieran Conboy,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Conboy%2C+Kieran,"Centre for Innovation & Structural Change, NUI GalwayGalwayIreland

Despite agreement on its importance to an organization's success, the concept is still fuzzy and vague, and there is little consensus regarding its compositional facets. Identifying the fundamental concepts, modeling principles, practical functions, and reach of the BM relevant to IS and other business concepts is by no means complete. This paper, following a comprehensive review of the literature, principally employs the content analysis method and utilizes a deductive reasoning approach to provide a hierarchical taxonomy of the BM concepts from which to develop a more comprehensive framework. This framework comprises four fundamental aspects. First, it identifies four primary BM dimensions along with their constituent elements forming a complete ontological structure of the concept. Second, it cohesively organizes the BM modeling principles, that is, guidelines and features. Third, it explains the reach of the concept showing its interactions and intersections with strategy, business processes, and IS so as to place the BM within the world of digital business. Finally, the framework explores three major functions of BMs within digital organizations to shed light on the practical significance of the concept. Hence, this paper links the BM facets in a novel manner offering an intact definition. In doing so, this paper provides a unified conceptual framework for the BM concept that we argue is comprehensive and appropriate to the complex nature of businesses today. This leads to fruitful implications for theory and practice and also enables us to suggest a research agenda using our conceptual framework.","['business model', 'conceptual framework', 'content analysis', 'taxonomy', 'information systems']",Youngjin Yoo,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Yoo%2C+Youngjin,,

While prior research has examined the factors that lead to continued usage behavior, little knowledge has been established as to what extent characteristics of the users of process modeling grammars inform usage behavior. In this study, a theoretical model is advanced that incorporates determinants of continued usage behavior as well as key antecedent individual difference factors of the grammar users, such as modeling experience, modeling background and perceived grammar familiarity. Findings from a global survey of 529 grammar users support the hypothesized relationships of the model. The study offers three central contributions. First, it provides a validated theoretical model of post-adoptive modeling grammar usage intentions. Second, it discusses the effects of individual difference factors of grammar users in the context of modeling grammar usage.

We introduce a framework that combines the benefit evaluation steps of identification, forecasting and assessment. Based on insights gained in a 3-year research project with case studies in logistics, we refine a process-based IT-benefits classification and subsequently derive six types of RFID benefits that support the systematic identification of benefits, as well as the selection of forecast and assessment methods. We discuss how our framework can facilitate and enhance RFID investment decisions and guide future research activities.","['RFID', 'cost–benefit analysis', 'logistics']",Jens Strüker,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Str%C3%BCker%2C+Jens,,

To identify these differences, we suggest an analytical distinction between boundary factors and contextual contingencies, which can be used in a design and reconfiguration process. We argue that the process of designing shared electronic templates should be perceived as a common design process, where multiple stakeholders articulate, identify, and negotiate boundary factors and contextual contingencies. Boundary factors are then represented within the shared electronic system, whereas contextual contingencies form the basis for constructing localized versions of the shared application. All local versions include both boundary factors and the reconfigured contextual contingencies.","['healthcare technology', 'standardization', 'boundary factors', 'contextual contingencies', 'boundary objects', 'action research']",Teri MacDonald,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/MacDonald%2C+Teri,,

Much of the research on gender and IT assumes a unilateral effect: all organizational factors affect all women in the same ways. An alternative view that is explored in this research is that within-gender differences offer rich insights into the gender imbalance in the IT profession. The individual differences theory of gender and IT enabled us to examine variation in organizational influences on women through analysis of transcripts from in-depth interviews conducted with 92 women in the IT workforce in the U.S.A. The results show that three organizational factors – work–life balance, organizational climate, and mentoring – affected the women's career development in a range of ways. Our findings shed new light on what has been interpreted by other researchers as contradictory findings because our theoretical starting point is the assumption that women are not all the same, that within-gender variation is expected and that it provides an opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of gender relations in the IT field. Using this theory we were able to identify opportunities for the development of interventions by linking the themes embedded in the three workplace factors to the constructs of the theory. The individual identity construct revealed the ways in which a woman's demographic and professional characteristics affect her career choices. The individual influences construct focused attention on the ways in which differences in personality, abilities, and influential people shape one's career.

As it is intractable to directly study the performance of strategies on real projects, we conducted a comprehensive empirically based simulation under a variety of conditions of requirements dynamism, project size, and duration. Simulation results suggest that a mixed strategy for requirements prioritization seems to work best in all but cost for typical levels of dynamism on average. Our findings also indicate that, as theorized, PB and agile strategies perform well within opposite extremes of dynamism. However, they do not outperform the mixed strategies even within their home grounds – that is large and complex systems with stable requirements for PB, and small and dynamic projects for agile methods. Given the unknown, unknowable, or variable nature of dynamism and the dramatic differences in effectiveness for agile and PB strategies under extreme development scenarios, a mixed strategy appears to yield the best results overall. We introduce two mixed strategies – simply adding cost–benefit (CB) to the agile approach, and a more sophisticated ‘hybrid’ (HY) approach that modulates development iteration size to maximize the expected CB for each iteration. We propose a step-by-step method to implement this HY strategy. We provide a structured analysis of the benefits and assumptions of agile and PB requirements prioritization methods (e.g., Pareto optimization), and outline a framework for analyzing and assessing the effectiveness of strategies including several new metrics. This research can furthermore serve as a framework for future validation of the proposed mixed strategies using actual software projects.","['requirements prioritization', 'agile prioritization', 'requirements engineering', 'strategic and development planning', 'integration of plan-based and flexible/agile processes', 'risk management']",Daniel Port,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Port%2C+Daniel,"Department of Information Technology ManagementShidler College of Business, University of HawaiiManoaU.S.A.

Unfortunately, there is a lack of research on the impact that the object of an outsourcing decision may have on the factors considered when making such a decision. The impact of organizational size and the firm's strategy has also not been conclusively established in the literature. This paper examines and compares the different supplier, internal, technology and cost factors considered when outsourcing Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) or Decision Support Systems (DSSs) (the object of a decision). It also examines the divergent decision factors for large, medium and small organizations, and the competitive strategy's impact on the factors that are considered. The paper is based on a study with samples from four large SAP Conferences and includes 1889 individuals working in organizations that use enterprise resource planning software. This research found that the object being outsourced, the firm's competitive strategies, and the organizational size are factors that significantly influence the outsourcing decision process. We found that the relative importance of decision factors for the outsourcing of OLTP is significantly different from those for a DSS and that, where the outsourcing object is of strategic importance, there is a closer attention to internal factors. Our findings confirm that outsourcing strategies are aligned with organizational strategies. For example, cost factors dominate in the outsourcing decision among organizations that employ a low-costs strategy as compared to those following a differentiation or niche strategy. Also, compared to firms pursuing other competitive strategies, for the outsourcing of DSS, differentiators place a significantly higher emphasis on supplier factors. Regarding the role of company size, we found significant differences in the importance given to supplier, internal, technology, and cost factors by organizations of different sizes. For example, compared to smaller organizations, larger organizations gave less importance to supplier and technology factors and more importance to cost factors.","['Information Systems', 'outsourcing', 'management']",Bjarne Berg,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Berg%2C+Bjarne,"Department of Business Information Systems & Operations ManagementThe Belk College of Business Administration, University of North Carolina at CharlotteCharlotteNCU.S.A.

This paper aims to develop a comprehensive classification of drivers for web site redesign based on interviews with various members of staff from SMEs in the U.K. that have recently redesigned their web sites. A sequential mixed-methodological analysis, involving the use of qualitative and quantitative data analysis, was used to develop the classification. This enabled the development of a framework that classified seven main categories of drivers for web site redesign. The drivers identified were: changing business requirements, evolving internet strategies, addressing user needs, maintenance, changing technology, pressure from peers/competitors, and the influence of developers. However, only the first four were found to be significant in the study. The categorisation and the findings suggest a number of key determinants not explicitly addressed by other work.

The contributions of this paper are firstly, to provide an instrument to the academic and practitioner communities interested in the topic of web site evolution.

There have been some attempts to study the dynamic nature of websites, but there is still little research evidence to explain why and how SMEs evolve their web presence. This paper aims to develop a comprehensive classification of drivers for web site redesign based on interviews with various members of staff from SMEs in the U.K. that have recently redesigned their web sites. A sequential mixed-methodological analysis, involving the use of qualitative and quantitative data analysis, was used to develop the classification. This enabled the development of a framework that classified seven main categories of drivers for web site redesign. The drivers identified were: changing business requirements, evolving internet strategies, addressing user needs, maintenance, changing technology, pressure from peers/competitors, and the influence of developers. However, only the first four were found to be significant in the study. The categorisation and the findings suggest a number of key determinants not explicitly addressed by other work. In addition, the findings provide little support for the staged approach to e-commerce progression as few companies reported the implementation of sophisticated internet technology features as a main reason for their web site redesigns. The contributions of this paper are firstly, to provide an instrument to the academic and practitioner communities interested in the topic of web site evolution. Secondly, the categorisation of drivers for redesign and the individual reasons found in this study are expected to provide assistance to SME managers to justify, plan and strategise internet investments realistically and effectively.","['web site redesign', 'Stage Models', 'SMEs', 'change framework', 'eCommerce', 'internet investment']",Enrique Frias-Martinez,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Frias-Martinez%2C+Enrique,,Guy.Fitzgerald@brunel.ac.uk

Our study is informed by the literature on IS adoption, protection-motivation theory, deterrence theory, and organisational behaviour, and is motivated by the fundamental premise that the adoption of information security practices and policies is affected by organisational, environmental, and behavioural factors. We develop an Integrated Protection Motivation and Deterrence model of security policy compliance under the umbrella of Taylor-Todd's Decomposed Theory of Planned Behaviour. Furthermore, we evaluate the effect of organisational commitment on employee security compliance intentions. Finally, we empirically test the theoretical model with a data set representing the survey responses of 312 employees from 78 organisations. Our results suggest that (a) threat perceptions about the severity of breaches and response perceptions of response efficacy, self-efficacy, and response costs are likely to affect policy attitudes; (b) organisational commitment and social influence have a significant impact on compliance intentions; and (c) resource availability is a significant factor in enhancing self-efficacy, which in turn, is a significant predictor of policy compliance intentions.

In an attempt to fill this research gap, this study employs a socio-cognitive perspective, namely the concept of frames analysis, to investigate how the managers and employees of a financial institution make sense of IS security certification, BS 7799 Part 2, and how these interpretations influence their actions. Using an interpretive case study approach, the findings show that the expectations of management have a strong impact on the implementation of the certification process. Moreover, the incongruence between the perceptions of managers and those of the certification team and other employees means that IS security management concepts may not be fully embedded in the organization's work practices and routines. This article argues that during the certification process, managers should place more emphasis on the identification of frame incongruence and undertake early intervention to align frames in order to achieve overall security effectiveness in the organization.","['IS security', 'technological frames', 'IS security standard', 'security certification', 'interpretive research', 'institutionalization']",Carol W Hsu,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Hsu%2C+Carol+W,"Department of Information ManagementNational Taiwan UniversityTaiwan

A research model was developed by adopting and expanding the protection motivation theory from health psychology, which has successfully been used to investigate the effect of threat and coping appraisal on protective actions. A questionnaire-based field survey with 239 U.S. SMB executives was conducted, and the data were analyzed using partial least squares (PLS). This study demonstrates that threat and coping appraisal successfully predict SMB executives’ anti-malware software adoption intention, leading to SMB adoption. In addition, considerable variance in adoption intention and actual SMB adoption is addressed by social influence from key stakeholders and situation-specific variables, such as IT budget and vendor support. Further, the generalizability of the model was tested using industry type and IS expertise. The adoption intention of IS experts and IT intensive industries was mainly affected by threat appraisal and social influence, while that of non-IS experts and non-IT intensive industries was significantly influenced by coping appraisal and IT budget. Vendor support was a key facilitator of the anti-malware adoption for IS experts and IT intensive industry groups, while IT budget was for non-IS expert and non-IT intensive industry groups.

Unfortunately, implementing these large-scale systems is a complex and risky endeavor.

However, unlike the past, many business professionals are knowledgeable about information technology (IT) and are increasingly capable of contributing to IS implementations from a technical perspective as well as a business perspective.

The RAE is held at irregular intervals of time, the latest being held in 2008 (RAE 2008). The motivation is accountability of government spending, but in fact many different objectives are ascribed to the exercise. RAE 2008 is fully described so that it can be used to raise debating issues around the general issue of research quality, a subject that appears to be of universal interest in Information Systems.

Technology-based retail services scenarios, with different levels of technology contact, are presented to supermarket shoppers (n=600). Results show that CTC, as a unique service attribute, moderates the effect of personality traits to customers’ attitude. The current study introduces this new service attribute that is applicable to ubiquitous computing services, application and design.","['technology-based services', 'ubiquitous computing', 'customer contact', 'consumer behaviour']",Pavlos A Vlachos,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Vlachos%2C+Pavlos+A,"Department of Management Science and TechnologyELTRUN Research Center, Athens University of Economics and BusinessAthensGreece

The CFP refers to the anxious sense of interest that a person has because of various types of threats to the person's state of being free from intrusion.

For example, research has shown that the CFP can have a negative influence on the adoption of information technology; but little is known about factors likely to influence such concern. This paper attempts to fill that gap. Because privacy is said to be a part of a more general ‘right to one's personality’, we consider the so-called ‘Big Five’ personality traits (agreeableness, extraversion, emotional stability, openness to experience, and conscientiousness) as factors that can influence privacy concerns. Protection motivation theory helps us to explain this influence in the context of an emerging pervasive technology: location-based services. Using a survey-based approach, we find that agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience each affect the CFP.

These results suggest that flame senders are generally worse off than flame recipients, which provides an important basis for the strategic use of flaming in negotiations.","['flaming', 'computer mediation', 'negotiation', 'concession', 'emotion', 'affect']",Richard Baskerville Editor-in-Chief,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Baskerville%2C+Richard+Editor-in-Chief,,

Then, beginning in 2000 and 2001, enrollments declined precipitously. This paper looks at the enrollment bubble and the dotcom bubble that drove IT enrollments. Although the enrollment bubble occurred worldwide, this paper focuses primarily on U.S. data, which is widely available, and secondarily on Western Europe data. The paper notes that the dotcom bubble was an investment disaster but that U.S. IT employment fell surprisingly little and soon surpassed the bubble's peak IT employment. In addition, U.S. IT unemployment rose to almost the level of total unemployment in 2003, then fell to traditional low levels by 2005. Job prospects in the U.S. and most other countries are good for the short term, and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics employment projections for 2006–2016 indicate that job prospects in the U.S. will continue to be good for most IT jobs. However, offshoring is a persistent concern for students in Western Europe and the United States. The data on offshoring are of poor quality, but several studies indicate that IT job losses from offshoring are small and may be counterbalanced by gains in IT inshoring jobs. At the same time, offshoring and productivity gains appear to be making low-level jobs such as programming and user support less attractive. This means that IS and computer science programs will have to focus on producing higher-level job skills among graduates. In addition, students may have to stop considering the undergraduate degree to be a terminal degree in IS and computer science.","['dotcom bubble', 'employment', 'inshoring', 'offshoring', 'outsourcing', 'unemployment']",Raymond R Panko,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Panko%2C+Raymond+R,"Shidler College of Business, University of HawaiiHonoluluHIU.S.A.

A questionnaire defined business change, IT change, and alignment as multi-item scaled questions, and planning horizon as a single, nonscaled one.

These will affect stakeholders (upon whom promoters depend) with varying degrees of power and with varying degrees of interest in the system. Identifying stakeholders and understanding the sources of their attitudes will enable promoters to meet their expectations more fully, and hence encourage acceptance. We examine these issues through a theoretically based study of an attempt to introduce an Electronic Patient File system in The Netherlands. All saw that the system would benefit patients, yet powerful players resisted its implementation, fearing it would affect their interests.

One answer to this problem might be to adopt a systems approach to IS planning.

In this paper, we use the systems theory of boundary critique to derive a set of questions to help practitioners reflect on different possible boundaries for IS planning exercises. These should be seen as complementary to existing systems approaches rather than as a replacement for them, enabling the latter to be practised more critically.

In developing our arguments, the paper synthesizes perspectives from information economics, transaction cost economics, and literature on institution-based trust to develop the EM-Trust Framework. Drawing from information economics, the paper contends that EM embody certain inefficiencies, which in turn contribute towards heightening consumer uncertainty, especially under conditions of high information specificity. Heightened consumer uncertainty subsequently reduces consumer trust in EM. It is only in the face of uncertainty and a loss of trust in EM that consumers transfer their need to trust in intermediaries.

A mini-case of online mortgage marketplaces is used to illustrate the EM-Trust Framework, thus creating threads for more insightful investigations in the future.","['Electronic Markets', 'inefficiencies', 'uncertainty', 'information specificity', 'institution-based trust', 'intermediaries', 'transaction cost', 'agency cost', 'e-commerce']",Sutirtha Chatterjee,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Chatterjee%2C+Sutirtha,"Department of Information SystemsWashington State UniversityPullmanWAU.S.A.

Lamb & Kling, 2003) to provide a more fine-grained analysis concentrating on the relationships among the radiology practitioners, the technology (an enterprise-wide Health Information System), and a larger social milieu surrounding its use. This study offers several theoretical and practical implications for technology assimilation in the health and radiology industry regarding the important roles social interactions, individual self-perceptions, organisational mandates and policies can play in assimilating new ICTs.","['ICT authority assimilation', 'health informatics practice', 'social actor model']",Bruce Rowlands,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Rowlands%2C+Bruce,"Griffith UniversityBrisbaneAustralia

Especially, although there are a number of variables and categories that have been found empirically to be related to adoption behavior, there is little in the way of evidence to suggest the origin or motivation behind the adoption. Thus, this study investigates the underlying motivations and driving forces behind the adoption of RFID using the theory of technology-push and need-pull. In this study, an organizational RFID adoption model is proposed and empirically tested by a survey using a sample of 126 senior executives in U.S. hospitals. The model posits that three categories of factors, technology push, need pull, and presence of champions, determine the likelihood of adopting RFID within organizations. This study also found that the relationships between those three categories and the likelihood of adopting RFID are strengthened or weakened by organizational readiness.","['technology push', 'need pull', 'radio frequency identification', 'healthcare']",Cheon-Pyo Lee,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Lee%2C+Cheon-Pyo,"Division of BusinessCarson-Newman CollegeJefferson CityTNU.S.A.

These applications allow patients to both communicate with their providers and access personal medical information, such as laboratory results. Research within medical informatics explores, and debates, the utility of such functions from the patient and physician perspectives. However, work does not examine factors influencing patient use, assuming that once built and deployed patients will come. Hence, the current research empirically investigates patient behavioral intentions (BI) with respect to (a) use of electronic communications functions and (b) accessing of individual medical information through an Internet-based patient–physician portal. Surveying 294 patients, this work incorporates individual factors, namely computer self-efficacy and personal innovativeness in the domain of information technology, with technology-based factors identified in the Technology Acceptance Model. The analysis finds that usefulness and innovativeness have a positive direct effect on BI with respect to both functions, namely communications and information access. Additionally, patients with greater healthcare needs foresee increased use of portals to access their personal medical information. Finally, patients in primary care, as opposed to specialist, provider settings intend to engage in electronic communications.","['computer self-efficacy', 'healthcare', 'patient–physician portals', 'personal innovativeness with information technology', 'TAM']",Richard Klein,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Klein%2C+Richard,"Department of ManagementCollege of Business and Behavioral Sciences, Clemson UniversityClemsonSouth CarolinaU.S.A.

However, relatively little research has been undertaken to determine the drivers for realising B2B e-commerce benefits within these organisations. A survey research was conducted to examine the relationships between B2B e-commerce benefits, IT investment evaluation methodologies (IEM), IT benefit realisation processes (BRP), B2B e-commerce adoption readiness, and IT maturity in large Australian organisations. An IT investment management model was developed to test these relationships. The results had empirically validated the model and indicate that a higher level of BRP adoption and increased level of B2B e-commerce adoption readiness had a significant direct relationship with B2B e-commerce benefits. In addition, the level of B2B e-commerce adoption readiness, and the level of IEM and BRP adoption were significantly influenced by the level of IT maturity. However, the use of IEM alone had only an indirect positive influence on B2B e-commerce benefits through the higher level of BRP adoption and increased level of B2B e-commerce adoption readiness.","['IT maturity', 'IT investment evaluation methodologies', 'IT benefit realisation processes', 'B2B e-commerce adoption readiness', 'B2B e-commerce benefits']",Janice Burn,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Burn%2C+Janice,"School of Management, Edith Cowan University Joondalup Western AustraliaAustralia

Organizational reliance on packaged software also creates dependence on vendors that gives them influence over the organization's upgrade decision.

This paper proposes a conceptual framework, based on institutional theory and systems ontology, to assess the misalignments between package functionality and organisational requirements. We suggest that these misalignments can arise from incompatibility in the externally imposed or voluntarily adopted structures embedded in the organisation and package, as well as differences in the way the meaning of organisational reality is ontologically represented in the deep or surface structure of packages. The synthesis of the institutional-ontological dimensions leads us to identify four types of misalignments with varying degrees of severity – imposed-deep, imposed-surface, voluntary-deep, and voluntary-surface – and to predict their likely resolution. We test the predictions using over 400 misalignments from package implementations at three different sites. The findings support the predictions: the majority of imposed-deep misalignments were resolved via package customisation. Imposed-surface and voluntary-deep misalignments were more often resolved via organisational adaptation and voluntary-surface misalignments were almost always resolved via organisational adaptation. The extent of project success also appeared to be influenced by the number of misalignments and the proportion of imposed-deep misalignments.

Review of IS research on job stress/burnout reveals that this body of work has relied heavily on general OB theory (parsimonious models generalizable across a variety of occupations and social contexts). More recently, scholars have argued for the addition of an occupation-specific approach to complement general OB theory, incorporating factors and concerns particular to a profession/work environment to increase explanatory power and relevance. The purpose of the exploratory study in this paper is to provide a foundation for such an occupation-specific research agenda on burnout in the IT profession. As an initial step, we employ social representations theory and methods to understand how IT professionals today make sense of and assign meaning to burnout in the context of their work. Transcripts from in-depth interviews of 20 IT professionals were content-analyzed and 22 key topics (concepts) were identified. Quantitative methods, including analysis of similarity, were used to create a social representations ‘map’ reflecting these professionals' views of burnout. The study contributes to the development of a renewed research agenda by pinpointing highly salient issues and specific work contexts warranting priority in future investigations.","['burnout', 'job stress', 'IT professionals', 'social representations theory']",John J Cater III,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Cater%2C+John+J+III,"Department of Management and MarketingNicholls State UniversityThibodauxLAU.S.A.

It uses a revelatory case study of the very large network orchestrated by Manchester United Football Club, a global sporting and entertainment brand that is partnered by some of the most successful consumer brands in the world and has an estimated 70 million fans (MUFC, 2007). We use business process modelling and systems theoretical concepts to investigate the complex horizontal and vertical relationships between partner firms and then develop a multi-level model of network operation, sustainability and governance. Inter-organisational networks are open systems that are sustained far from equilibrium by the constant flow of materials, energy and information that we have called a ‘value flow system’. Here we model the flow of commercial ‘value’ through the network that sustains it in a far from equilibrium state. The contribution for managers of orchestrator firms is an architectural model of the properties and mechanisms of network orchestration that aids value flow for network building and maintenance. The implication for coordination researchers is a development of Malone and Crowston's coordination theory (1994) via the novel introduction of Hierarchy Theory to this domain.","['Manchester United', 'business process modelling', 'cultivation', 'network', 'orchestration', 'inter-organisational', 'B2B', 'open systems', 'Hierarchy Theory']",Duncan R Shaw,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Shaw%2C+Duncan+R,"Nottingham University Business SchoolNottinghamU.K.

While curriculum coherence can be jeopardized by poor curriculum design, misalignment between module content and/or misalignment between module or course aims can cause serious coherence issues over time. Misalignment of this type is exacerbated by the traditional processes of curriculum (re)design, which rely heavily on the (singular) interpretation of highly abstract documents, such as module syllabi and course specifications – often produced by curriculum designers in isolation. To improve curriculum coherence, this paper examines the use of a programme management framework as a means of (a) ‘humanizing’ the abstract aims and goals of curricula schemes and (b) managing the delivery and evolution of curricula in relation to the stakeholders in the process of delivery. The practical use of the framework is examined in the context of a Masters-level course in ‘Information Systems Management’. An action research approach is used to demonstrate the practical utility of the framework in terms of (a) improving communication of curricula, (b) improving the coherence between modules and between modules and course and (c) removing content redundancy. Analysis of outcomes demonstrates a significant positive impact of the use of the framework in relation to the above points from the perspective of all stakeholders.

The purpose of this paper is to present a journal ranking for business and management based on a statistical analysis of the Harzing data set which contains 13 rankings. The primary aim of the analysis is two-fold – to investigate relationships between the different rankings, including that between peer rankings and citation behaviour; and to develop a ranking based on four groups that could be useful for the RAE. Looking at the different rankings, the main conclusions are that there is in general a high degree of conformity between them as shown by a principal components analysis. Cluster analysis is used to create four groups of journals relevant to the RAE. The higher groups are found to correspond well with previous studies of top management journals and also gave, unlike them, equal coverage to all the management disciplines. The RAE Business and Management panel have a huge and unenviable task in trying to judge the quality of over 10,000 publications and they will inevitably have to resort to some standard mechanistic procedures to do so.

When one component provides a service that the Web application requires, it is often not possible to bind the two systems together if they were not programmed to have compatible collaboration specifications. Modeling the adaptation between a Web application and external assets becomes therefore an essential issue in any realistic model-driven development scenario. However, most of the existing Web Engineering proposals do not take this issue into account, or they simply address it at the implementation level (in a platform-specific way). In this work, we discuss the problems involved in dealing with component adaptation within the context of Model-Driven Web Engineering and show how design patterns can help addressing it. We first identify the major interoperability problems that can happen when integrating third-party application or legacy systems into our Web systems, and then propose the mechanisms that need to be put in place at the design level to generate the appropriate specification of adapters that compensate for the possible mismatches and differences. We base our proposal on well-known design patterns as they are established solutions to recurring problems, and the generation of code from them is normally straightforward.","['model-driven development', 'Web Engineering', 'interoperability', 'adaptation', 'patterns']",Nathalie Moreno Vergara,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Vergara%2C+Nathalie+Moreno,"Dpto. de Lenguajes y Ciencias de la Computación, Universidad de MálagaMalagaSpain

In contrast to co-located teams and purely virtual teams, these ‘hybrid’ teams combine face-to-face communication with computer-mediated interaction. In this paper, we report a qualitative study of management practices in three hybrid teams in one organization. We adopt the theoretical approach of strategic contradiction, in which apparently contradictory pairs of elements can be managed by attending to their possible synergies or clarifying their distinctions so as to make balanced trade-offs over time. Our data reveal four sets of paradoxical frames in hybrid teams: remoteness–closeness, cultural uniformity–cultural diversity, rationality–emotionality, and control–empowerment. In referencing these paradoxical frames, teams engaged in three cognitive processes: (a) integrating to produce synergies between opposing tensions, (b) differentiating to clarify distinctions between opposing tensions and to balance trade-offs over time, and (c) polarizing to remove tensions between opposing elements by using one element to reduce the effects of another. Both integrating and differentiating processes were found to be instrumental to sustaining contradictions as interdependent dualities, whereas polarizing processes were found to preserve contradictions as dualisms. Our findings advance the understanding of managing strategic contradictions by showing how managers influence cognitive processes that paradoxically emphasize remoteness and closeness, cultural uniformity and cultural diversity, rationality and emotionality, and control and empowerment.","['virtual teams', 'hybrid teams', 'dualities']",Karlene C Cousins,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Cousins%2C+Karlene+C,"Department of Decision Sciences and Information SystemsCollege of Business, Florida International UniversityMiamiFLUSA

Following extensive literature review on innovation adoption–diffusion theories and qualitative field study, a research model was developed which treated six sets of antecedents of small business's attitude towards B2B trading exchanges. The findings revealed that external influences raise the small business's awareness of an innovation. This awareness leads to the evaluation of the perceived direct and indirect benefits and a positive evaluation leads to a positive attitude towards the innovation.

Yet, organizations seldom use these systems to the fullest extent and attain the expected return on investment. This paper addresses the issue of system underutilization by investigating Extended Use, which refers to using more system features to support one's tasks. Extended Use was examined in the nomological networks of the IS Continuance (ISC) Model and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). A field survey was conducted in a large manufacturing firm that had successfully implemented a popular enterprise resource planning solution for more than 2 years. All paths in both ISC and TAM were statistically significant. A synthesized model was later proposed and examined in a post hoc analysis. The results indicate that the synthesized model, as compared to ISC and TAM, explained slightly higher variances in Extended Use, Perceived Usefulness (PU), and Satisfaction. Specifically, both Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) and PU both affected Extended Use. Interestingly, Satisfaction has no direct impact on Extended Use in the presence of PU and PEOU. In contrast to most technology acceptance research, PEOU has a stronger behavioral impact than that of PU. This research provides a framework that explains Extended Use and is one of the few studies that investigates IS use behavior that exceeds simple, shallow, and routine use.","['Extended Use', 'technology acceptance model', 'IS continuance model', 'infusion']",J J Po-An Hsieh,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Po-An+Hsieh%2C+J+J,"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom KowloonHong KongChina

There has been far less research on the use of IT by customers, including technology at the point of sale (POS). The provision of customer-oriented IT at the POS implies integrating content in different formats and from different supply chain members in various devices. Therefore, research on such phenomena holds the potential to extend the literature on IT use, blending in perspectives that derive from content integration. This paper uses a case research method to describe the first real-world application of content integration at the POS. Literature on IT use and content integration guide the subsequent analysis. The paper offers some conclusions concerning content integration, customer use, and satisfaction.","['IT use', 'content integration', 'radio frequency identification (RFID)']",Claudia Loebbecke,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Loebbecke%2C+Claudia,"Department of Media ManagementUniversity of CologneCologneGermany

The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of the richness of consumers’ interaction with products and with sales representatives on changes in their attitude towards and their intention to use business-to-consumer (B2C) EC. Controlled lab experiments were conducted using two types of products and multiple levels of interaction richness. The results show that interaction richness has positive impact on consumers’ attitude towards B2C EC. Additionally, the study finds that the impact is stronger in the case of purchasing a high-complexity product than a low-complexity product, and that consumers’ attitude change is positively related with their intention to use B2C EC. Differential effects on two facets of attitude, ease of use in accomplishing the tasks and usefulness were observed leading to interesting implications and future research directions.","['change in attitude', 'usefulness', 'ease of use', 'intention to accept and use', 'electronic commerce', 'interaction richness']",Jungjoo Jahng,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Jahng%2C+Jungjoo,"Graduate School of Business, Seoul National UniversitySeoulSouth Korea

Results indicate that perceived critical mass influences use intentions directly and through perceptions of the characteristics of the innovation. The perceived innovation characteristics impact attitude toward use, which in turn impacts use intentions. The model predicts a sizable and significant portion of both attitudes and use intentions.

By using content analysis methodology, the services and functions of U.S. county e-Government portals are scrutinized. The investigation instrument is based on political and technological theories, an e-Government stage model, and the review of literature. The research finds that U.S. counties’ adoption of e-Government is highly associated with certain socioeconomic factors; in addition, the functionalities of U.S. county e-Government portals are significantly related to six socioeconomic factors according to the multiple regression analysis. The research provides insights for government officials and practitioners to understand and improve e-Government practice. It also sheds light on e-Government research by bringing in a valuable research instrument and comprehensive data about e-Government adoption. The implications for future research are discussed.","['e-Government', 'content analysis', 'local government', 'stage model', 'socioeconomic']",Zhenyu Huang,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Huang%2C+Zhenyu,"Business Information Systems DepartmentCollege of Business Administration, Central Michigan UniversityMount PleasantMIU.S.A.

Drawing from the argument that all categories and classification schemes are grounded in politics, we critique the process by which the recent study in question (and several earlier studies) have derived the set of journals from which they count researcher publications. Based on a critical examination of the widespread inclusion of practitioner outlets, and the consistent exclusion of European scholarly IS journals, we develop our own arguments for which journals should be included in such evaluations of researcher productivity. We conduct our own analysis of IS researcher productivity for the period 1999–2003, based on articles published in a geographically balanced set of 12 IS journals, and then we compare our results with those from the recent study in question and their predecessors. Our results feature a more diverse set of scholars – both in terms of location (specifically, the country and continent in which the researchers are employed) and gender. We urge future studies of IS research productivity to follow our practice of including high-quality European journals, while eschewing practitioner-oriented publications (such as Harvard Business Review and Communications of the ACM). We also advocate that such studies count only research contributions (e.g., research articles), and that other genres of non-research articles – such as book reviews, ‘issues and opinions’ pieces and editorial introductions – not be conflated with counts of research contributions.","['IS faculty', 'research productivity', 'global scholarship']",Michael J Gallivan,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Gallivan%2C+Michael+J,"CIS DepartmentRobinson College of Business, Georgia State UniversityAtlantaGAU.S.A.

Furthermore, this research indicates the existence of complementarities among the Web orientations. Thus, existing e-information was found as critical for enabling e-transaction to impact upon firm performance. Additionally, e-information and e-communication (jointly considered) were found to mutually reinforce the impact of e-transaction on firm performance.

Transferring a model to another cultural context should be subjected to rigorous testing, and a few studies have begun to examine the applicability of TAM in a small variety of cultures. This study contributes to the growing multi-cultural examination of TAM, and demonstrates that although the model has been successful in predicting adoption behaviours in some international settings, it might not hold in all cultures. Almost 4000 students from several universities around the world provided the data for the study. Data analysis revealed that the TAM model does not hold for certain cultural orientations. Most significantly, low Uncertainty Avoidance, high Masculinity, high-Power Distance, and high Collectivism seem to nullify the effects of Perceived Ease of Use and/or Perceived Usefulness.

Based on the study's results, pre-purchase services that support search and evaluation of products replete in e-commerce systems have limited effect on customer loyalty. Among transaction-related services, transparency of the billing mechanism positively impacts customer loyalty. Customers shun any hidden costs associated with product acquisition. Post-purchase services consisting of support of order tracking, on-time delivery, and customer support positively influence customer loyalty. These findings imply that Web-based stores need to pay more attention to post-purchase services in their strategy to retain customers.

Among transaction-related services, transparency of the billing mechanism positively impacts customer loyalty. Customers shun any hidden costs associated with product acquisition. Post-purchase services consisting of support of order tracking, on-time delivery, and customer support positively influence customer loyalty. These findings imply that Web-based stores need to pay more attention to post-purchase services in their strategy to retain customers. This is what will keep customers satisfied and willing to continue the relationship with a company over the long term.","['pre-purchase services', 'transaction-related services', 'post-purchase services', 'customer loyalty', 'e-commerce', 'e-business', 'B2C transactions']",Varun Grover,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Grover%2C+Varun,"Department of ManagementClemson UniversitySCClemsonU.S.A.

It explores some research questions that arise if we take such a view. A new agenda for IS research is developed, based upon six themes in computer art and related work in previous IS research. The link between IS and computer art is bi-directional: our theories of information systems could inform the study of computer art, and computer art could inform our information systems theories, possibly leading to modification or even abandonment of them. Twelve research questions are suggested, and potential barriers to IS researchers studying computer art are also discussed. The paper offers possibilities, not solutions, and makes an important contribution by suggesting new opportunities for innovative research in IS and by signposting some of the topics which could be addressed.","['computer art', 'digital art', 'reference discipline']",Briony J Oates,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Oates%2C+Briony+J,"School of Computing, University of TeessideMiddlesbroughU.K.

Enterprise information portals (EIPs) hold promise in this regard, offering each user a gateway to customized and personalized content. However, in large organizations EIP implementers face the complexity of tailoring portals for potentially thousands of users. A conceptual framework based on marketing fundamentals is developed to inform EIP implementation in this respect. It is argued that EIP implementers should view their user community as a number of distinct segments in order to address divergent needs more specifically (as opposed to a ‘one size fits all’ approach). For each identified segment, a ‘mix’ of content (product), distribution (place), promotion and price (cost) should be considered. The framework is applied to two cases of EIP implementation in large organizations. It is proposed that segmentation enables better planning of the overall EIP implementation effort. Considerations such as the number of user segments, customization, and personalization of content, and the funding of EIP development in large organizations are also discussed. The concepts elaborated here also hold theoretical relevance for other IS implementation contexts that involve very large user communities with diverse information requirements.","['enterprise information portals', 'implementation strategy', 'internal marketing', 'marketing mix applied to information technology']",Rens Scheepers,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Scheepers%2C+Rens,"Department of Information SystemsThe University of MelbourneVictoriaAustralia

Terms such as ‘adaptive’ and ‘evolutionary’ capture the organic nature of the development of a decision support system. However, the terms are rarely defined and their meaning varies widely in the research literature. The aim of this paper is to contribute to decision support systems theory by investigating and clearly specifying the nature of the evolutionary process of a DSS. Using insights from other disciplines and prior DSS research, a framework for understanding DSS evolution is developed based on the aetiology, lineage, and tempo of evolution. The descriptive validity of the framework is demonstrated by applying it to published DSS studies and to an intensive case study of DSS development. The framework and the case study findings are used to define a research agenda that is important for evolutionary DSS development.","['decision support systems', 'evolutionary development', 'case study']",David Arnott,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Arnott%2C+David,"Monash University3800VictoriaAustralia

The paper presents a hypothetical situation concerning the analysis of a loan approval system in a large bank. It assumes that ethnographers observed three systems analysis projects that applied different approaches in three identical banks. It uses hypothetical accounts of the three analysis efforts to propose likely differences in the process and in the results. These differences illustrate possible opportunities for cross-fertilization that might make each approach more powerful and reliable. The paper concludes that the most likely direction for cross-fertilization is from interpretive approaches to the other approaches. An earlier version of this paper was presented at the First International Workshop on Interpretive Approaches to Information Systems and Computing Research, SIG-IAM, Brunel University, July 25–27, 2002, to motivate discussion about the applications, strengths, and limitations of interpretive approaches and to help in the further development of systems analysis methods.","['systems analysis and design', 'work system method', 'interpretive workplace studies', 'information system design']",Steven Alter,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Alter%2C+Steven,"School of Business and Management, University of San FranciscoSan FranciscoCAUSA

This has resulted in the development of a variety of mixing pot hybrids that have had marginal impact upon product-based development, whose needs the approach has been configured to meet. This paper suggests that a concern to fit ethnomethodology into product-based development life cycles is a primary source of the difficulties encountered in moving ethnomethodology from design critique to design practice. In practice, ethnomethodology is largely employed in research rather than product development settings. Recognition of the real-world uses of ethnomethodology in design practice opens up the possibility of devising a hybrid methodology that actively supports the invention of the future. Accordingly, this paper articulates a distinct socio-technical model that provides an iterative structure for the constructive involvement of ethnomethodology in processes of technological innovation, the results of which may subsequently be subject to the rationalities and constraints of product development.","['ethnomethodology', 'design', 'hybrid discipline', 'technomethodology', 'socio-technical model of design']",Andy Crabtree,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Crabtree%2C+Andy,"School of Computer Science & IT, University of NottinghamNottinghamUK

We discuss formalisation, adaptation and objectivity in our theories, methodologies and implementations, and offer collaborative filtering and its extension, the path model, as examples of practical approaches to representation, which show, support and adapt with activity in a hermeneutic style.","['hermeneutics', 'system design', 'dynamics', 'user histories']",Matthew Chalmers,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Chalmers%2C+Matthew,"Computing Science, University of Glasgow, University AvenueGlasgowUK

In The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn states that a scientific discipline can be identified by reference to its underlying belief system, the ‘paradigm’ or ‘disciplinary matrix’, to which all workers in that field must commit. An important element of Kuhn's model is the notion of ‘scientific communities’. We consider here the belief system underlying Software Engineering (SE). We examine the extent to which a belief system analogous to the disciplinary matrix of a Kuhnian science can be identified in SE. Our preliminary fieldwork has comprised an examination of books used by SE students and practitioners, and in-depth interviews with a number of practitioners. The results of this study suggest that the current status of the theory of SE parallels Kuhn's ‘pre-paradigm’ stage of scientific development. At this early stage, theorists and practitioners are divided into schools. These schools are based on differences in the beliefs and models forming their disciplinary matrices. We conclude that the application by analogy of Kuhn's view of scientific activity to SE is justifiable. Our findings can assist both SE theorists and practitioners in improving the understanding of how and why software development projects succeed or fail. Our findings also provide a framework within which to place the beliefs, models and values which underlie SE. Such a framework can contribute to the discussion as to whether the software development-related aspects of Information Systems can be considered to be a discipline, and if so how that discipline is structured.","['kuhn', 'paradigm', 'disciplinary matrix', 'software engineering', 'information systems development']",Paul Wernick,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Wernick%2C+Paul,"Systems and Software Group, School of Computer Science, University of Hertfordshire, HatfieldHertfordshireUK

The goal was to investigate the circumstances surrounding the sudden and total upgrade of information technology and systems enabled (and necessitated) by the end of Eastern Block isolation from the West. The paper reports on 1992 contacts and site visits with four MBO privatised firms and 1999 follow-up contacts and site visits with the two surviving firms of that group. Analyses are presented, which draw on literature devoted to IT transitions and IS implementation. The notion of technological switchback is introduced to characterise the unique circumstances embodied by the situation under study. It involves a necessary and sudden advance in information technological capabilities, which comes at the expense of a significant and undesirable regression in information system effectiveness. Parallels are drawn to the plights of firms in other transitional economies and firms facing emerging ‘technological imperatives.’ Conclusions are elucidated, regarding effective short- and long-term adjustment to such situations.","['IS technology transfer', 'IS implementation', 'technological discontinuities', 'transitional economies']",Robert P Marble,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Marble%2C+Robert+P,"College of Business Administration, Creighton University 2500 California Plaza 68178OmahaNebraskaUSA

There are three key findings, namely: the emergence of aggregation-specific e-business applications; the emergence of collaboratively based ‘one to many’ business models; and the importance of trusted third parties in the adoption of higher-level complexity e-business applications by SMEs. Significantly, this work takes a deliberately provider perspective and complements the already considerable literature on SME IT adoption from a user and network perspective.

We analyse for each era the rate of adopting different types of ISPIs, identify who made adoption decisions for those ISPI types and determine whether these ISPIs originated internally or externally. Within the three organizations, the types and rates of ISPI adoptions varied significantly. These variations can be attributed to learning mechanisms, the influence of legacy platforms and differences in the boundary spanning activities. With the exception of base line technologies, project managers were the most prominent decision-maker group, suggesting a situated ISPI adoption process.

We argue that these differences may also extend to computer-mediated knowledge management systems (KMS), although previous research has not tested this empirically. Where employees are expected to use KMS for acquiring and sharing knowledge, we posit that some will gain more benefit than others, due to their innate personal characteristics, specifically gender and cognitive style. Based on a sample of 212 software developers in one large IS organization, we re-open these dormant debates about the effects of cognitive style and gender on technology usage. The paper contains four main findings. First, we present support for the proposition that cognitive style has an impact on KMS usage, although not for all components of the system. Second, that gender significantly affects KMS usage, with males being more likely to use such systems than females. Third, we find a small interaction effect between cognitive style and gender, but only for the use of data mining. Finally, the data suggest that there is a strong association between KMS usage levels and perceived usefulness. We conclude that if organizations do not recognize the inherent diversity of the workforce, and accommodate gender and cognitive style differences into their knowledge management strategies, they may be likely to propagate an intrinsic disadvantage, to the detriment of females and intuitive thinkers.","['Gender', 'cognitive style', 'knowledge sharing', 'knowledge management systems', 'user differences', 'perceived usefulness', 'usage']",W Andrew Taylor,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Taylor%2C+W+Andrew,"School of Management, University of BradfordBradfordUK

Although there is significant interest in the use of the Internet for business purposes, studies articulating issues that can guide business managers in its use are lacking. The purpose of this study is to examine the issue of business activity on the Internet and report the results of a survey on the ways in which businesses are making use of Internet-based information systems (IIS). In addition, the study investigates the relations between the implementation and performance of an IIS to examine its potential to provide benefits to IIS adopters. A total of 120 usable responses were obtained. This paper identifies pertinent issues and problems that are critical in developing an IIS. The results also show that volume sophistication and information contents in an IIS partially affect the extent of cost savings, financial performance, and service improvement.","['internet-based information systems', 'electronic commerce']",Sangjae Lee,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Lee%2C+Sangjae,"Department of Business AdministrationSejong University, Kunja-dongKwangjin-guSeoulKorea

Such decisions can vary from quickly identifying the problem, screening options and choosing a solution in a very straightforward way, to very extensive and repeated search, screen, design and negotiation activities that can take many years. There has been little explicit research into the process by which managers and organisations decide to develop IS applications. This research addresses this by analysing 20 IS decision-making processes, using a phase-based as well as an attribute-based approach. Mintzberg's typology is used to characterise seven types of IS decisions from a phase-based or process-based perspective. For the attribute approach, the decisions have been analysed on the basis of subjective/objective and offensive/defensive contrasts and placed in one of the four following categories: innovative, rational, necessary or political. The paper concludes by identifying five factors that result in major differences in IS decision-making processes. These issues are: (1) whether there is scope to design a solution; (2) whether distinct alternatives have to be searched for; (3) the degree of urgency and necessity from the perspective of the decision-makers; (4) whether the decision can be subdivided in order to follow a gradual process path (planned vs incremental) and (5) the number and power of stakeholders involved in the process and the extent that their interests vary and contrast. The paper suggests that managers deciding on IS applications should be aware of these factors in order to design a process that fits best with the specific circumstances: no single process should be considered universally applicable. This conclusion is in contrast with many decision-making models rooted in the MIS-field, which suggest to use prescriptive and rational approaches to organise IS decision-making processes.","['information system', 'decision making', 'organisational context', 'IS decision making processes']",Albert Boonstra,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Boonstra%2C+Albert,"Faculty of Management and Organization, University of GroningenGroningenThe Netherlands

The focal claim of the argument is that the status of IS as an ‘academic discipline’ is not an ontological or an epistemological question but rather a political one. In defending this claim the paper will draw on the work of Foucault, in particular his discussion on the relation between power and knowledge. The paper will conclude that the advice given by Paul (2002) and others may be appropriate but for very different reasons. It will claim that it is equally important, if not more so, to know the reasons why claims to legitimacy may succeed or not, for such claims to be effective as a political programme.","['APS', 'knowledge-based view', 'resource-based view', 'resource-dependence view', 'transaction cost theory', 'selective sourcing', 'it decision making']",Ray J Paul,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Paul%2C+Ray+J,,

Co-opetition entails sharing knowledge that may be a key source of competitive advantage. Yet, the knowledge gained by cooperation may also be used for competition. However, there is little investigation of how this problem may be modelled and, hence, managed. A game–theoretic framework for analysing interorganisational knowledge sharing under co-opetition and guidelines for the management of explicit knowledge predicated on coordination and control theory has been proposed, but remains untested. This research empirically investigates these issues in the context of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). SMEs provide an interesting setting as they are knowledge generators, but are poor at knowledge exploitation. The paper uses data from U.K. SMEs to investigate co-opetition, management of knowledge sharing and the role of IS.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",P Powell,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Powell%2C+P,"Centre for Information Management, School of Management, University of BathBathUK

The prevailing hypothesis is that very low information search costs will enable buyers to expand their product information search and comparison beyond what is feasible in conventional markets. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the relative efficiency of product search in current travel service markets. We report the results of our analysis based on an experimental setting with 92 subjects. Our conclusions tend to disagree with previous predictions about the efficiency of electronic markets. The electronic markets observed were found to be at best as efficient as their conventional counterparts. Our results suggest that poor availability of product information and a lack of systems integration severely limit the efficiency of consumer search in present electronic markets.,"['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",Anssi Öörni,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/%C3%96%C3%B6rni%2C+Anssi,"Department of Information Systems ScienceHelsinki School of Economics and Business AdministrationHelsinkiFinland

It examines the enactment of a programme of long-term organizational change, focusing on the implementation of an alternative computer system in 1996. The analysis in this paper is informed by actor-network theory, both by an early statement of this approach developed by Callon in the sociology of translation, and also by concepts and ideas from Latour's more recent restatement of his own position. The paper examines how alternative interests emerged and were stabilized over time, in a way of arguing and acting among key players in the change programme, christened the Golden Circle. The story traces 4 years in the history of the London Ambulance Service, from the aftermath of October 1992 through the birth of the Golden Circle to the achievement of National Health Service (NHS) trust status. LASCAD was the beginning of the story, this is the middle, an end lies in the future, when the remaining elements of the change programme are enacted beyond the Golden Circle.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",K Mcgrath,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Mcgrath%2C+K,"Information Systems DepartmentLondon School of EconomicsLondonUK

Numerous benchmarking tools exist for small firms and they typically cover a range of activities, including strategic leadership, quality, and performance. However, most pay no or little attention to IT. Thus, this study aimed to identify IT practices in small firms that could be included in benchmarking tools. The study commenced with a review of existing literature to identify major areas of IT management relevant to small firms. This literature guided multiple-case study research of four engineering firms to identify IT practices. A second phase of the study evaluated evidence from 30 small engineering firms with between 20 and 100 employees. Six practices differentiated IT leaders from IT laggards. Three practices reflected senior management involvement and the other three reflected technological capability.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",P B Cragg,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Cragg%2C+P+B,"AFIS, University of CanterburyNew Zealand

This is indicative, firstly, of the magnitude of the problems involved in ERP systems implementation and, secondly, of the importance of the ex-ante evaluation and selection process of ERP software. This paper argues that ERP evaluation should extend its scope beyond operational improvements arising from the ERP software/product per se to the strategic impact of ERP on the competitive position of the organisation. Due to the complexity of ERP software, the intangible nature of both costs and benefits, which evolve over time, and the organisational, technological and behavioural impact of ERP, a broad perspective of the ERP systems evaluation process is needed. The evaluation has to be both quantitative and qualitative and requires an estimation of the perceived costs and benefits throughout the life-cycle of ERP systems. The paper concludes by providing a framework of the key issues involved in the selection process of ERP software and the associated costs and benefits.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",C J Stefanou,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Stefanou%2C+C+J,"Technological Educational Institution (TEI) of Thessaloniki, SindosThessalonikiGreece

Open source can be seen as a movement, where communities of highly skilled programmers collectively develop software, often of a quality that outperforms commercial proprietary software. These movements are based on virtual networking on the Internet and the web. They are loosely coupled communities kept together by strong common values related to hacker culture. Work seems to be totally distributed, delegated and loosely coupled. The highly skilled members contribute to the collective effort of free software development.

It extends existing GSS literature by examining the critical roles of facilitation and leadership simultaneously within a single study. A 2×2 factorial controlled laboratory experiment was conducted. A preference task, which had no objective correct answers, was employed. Ten five-person groups completed each treatment. Independent variables were facilitation (with vs without) and leadership (with vs without). During their meetings, facilitators and leaders carried out task and interactional interventions respectively. Dependent variables were measures of meeting success (post-meeting consensus, decision confidence, discussion quality, and process satisfaction).

Six case studies of IT implementation projects have been conducted, focusing on the challenges in the implementation process as seen from the perspective of the implementation team. Being of an exploratory nature, the study has identified a large number of issues that have influenced the different stages in the implementation process. The implementation context studied is found to imply several additional challenges for the implementation team, compared to ‘traditional’ intra-organizational IT implementation. This is a result of greater autonomy among the participating units, heterogeneous technological platforms and logistical barriers in the implementation activities. Resistance from the organizational units, technological incompatibility and lack of incentives for adopting new work practices, are identified as major barriers in the implementation. In general, the implementation is found to require a process of maturation, where implementers and adopters gradually develop an understanding of how the technology can support the organizational needs.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",B E Munkvold,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Munkvold%2C+B+E,"Department of Information SystemsAgder College, Serviceboks 4224604KristiansandNorway",

If these conditions are not present then in all probability the system will be a failure. Ensuring a system is successful from a user's perspective is primarily about usability. There are many aspects of information system design that impact on usability including: online help, the design of the user interface, system and error messages. These aspects need consideration early in the development cycle. This paper discusses the need for improved usability design in information systems and presents results of recent research which examined the role of technical communicators in systems development and explored the extent to which their work improved system usability. The study found that from a user's perspective an improved system results when technical communicators are involved particularly in the early stages of the development process.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",J Fisher,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Fisher%2C+J,"Victoria University, PO Box 14428, MCMC8001MelbourneAustralia",

In contrast are the views of the anti-realists and epistemological relativists for whom such an argument is nonsensical—involving as it does the appeal to truths outside or beyond our best current knowledge. In this paper, using recent work from within the area, the realist and relativist models of information systems research and methodological design are identified. Following this an analysis is presented which debates whether relativism in information systems design, as a model of epistemology, provides practitioners and researchers with directions for achieving the epistemological state it describes. Finally, the tenet that practitioners and researchers are able to learn and adhere to the principles of relativism and from this will be able to provide an improved methodology for information systems design is questioned.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",F Wilson,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Wilson%2C+F,"The Information Systems Research Centre, University of SalfordM5 4WTSalfordUK",

Software reuse is a potential strategy to address recurring systems development problems such as high development cost, low programmer productivity and long systems delivery lead time. However, the barriers associated with reuse implementation are significant. A better understanding of the administrative changes that facilitate reuse implementation is required to further research and practice in this area. We conceptualise reusability as a software process innovation that constitutes administrative and technological dimensions. Drawing from the synchronous innovation concepts, four theoretical models of the interrelationships between these dimensions of reusability and systems delivery performance are developed. Using the data collected through a postal survey these models are empirically evaluated. The results strongly suggest that administrative innovations intervene in the relationship between technological innovations and systems delivery performance and vice versa. This implies that synergies exists between administrative and technological dimensions of reusability which are more important in explaining variance in systems delivery performance than these dimensions individually. Implications of the study for IS theory, future research and practice are identified and discussed.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",T Ravichandran,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Ravichandran%2C+T,"Lally School of Management & Technology, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute12180TroyNYUSA",

While the predominant concern of this literature has been strategic in orientation, the management of information is a neglected area. By drawing on a diverse range of literature in the international business, strategic management, organization design, and information system (IS) disciplines this paper develops a conceptual framework for analysing information management in the global enterprise, providing a basis for organising existing literature on the topic and for creating a map of the field. This framework is structured around four domains: global business drivers, global business strategy, global business model and global information strategy. It highlights the role of information technology (IT) as supporting global business strategies while at the same time IT can also be a major catalyst in the globalisation process itself. In the context of the global information strategy, the paper develops a distinction between business infostructure, IT infrastructure and the IS/IT suprastructure. Significant relationships between the four domains of the framework are surfaced and an agenda for action developed.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",J Peppard,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Peppard%2C+J,"Information Systems Research Centre, Cranfield School of ManagementMK43 0ALCranfieldBedfordUK",

Recent examples are the Davis, Kottemann, and Remus production planning experiments. According to the researchers, these experiments demonstrate that DSS what-if analysis creates an ‘illusion of control’ that causes users to overestimate its effectiveness. Such experimental findings are contrary to case-supported DSS theory. This paper examines the discrepancy. It first overviews the decision-making process, presents a generic DSS, identifies the theoretical role of the DSS in improving decision making, develops a multiple criteria model of DSS effectiveness, and gives a DSS for delivering the model to users. Illustrating with recent empirical investigations and the Davis, Kottemann, and Remus studies, the DSS-delivered model is used to reconcile the incongruity between the experimental findings and the case-supported theory. The paper concludes with a discussion of the article's implications for information systems research and practice.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",G A Forgionne,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Forgionne%2C+G+A,Information Systems DepartmentUniversity of Maryland Baltimore County21250CatonsvilleMDUSA,

In this study, ten content characteristics of formal information technology strategy are identified from the research literature as potential implementation predictors. These are descriptions of: (i) resources needed for the implementation; (ii) user involvement during the implementation; (iii) analyses of the organization; (iv) anticipated changes in the environment; (v) solutions to potential resistance during the implementation; (vi) information technology to be implemented; (vii) projects' relevance to the business plan; (viii) responsibility for the implementation; (ix) management support for the implementation; and (x) clarity of the documentation. An IT strategy implementation matrix is introduced to illustrate the relationship between the expired time horizon and the IT strategy implementation extent. The matrix can be used by organizations to monitor their IT strategy implementation performance over time. A survey was conducted in Norway whereupon the return of 471 completed questionnaires resulted in a satisfactory response rate of 43%. Formal IT strategy was reported in 40% of these organizations. The two significant predictors in the testing of hypotheses proved to be the description of responsibility for the implementation and the description of user involvement during the implementation.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",P Gottschalk,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Gottschalk%2C+P,"Department of Technology ManagementNorwegian School of ManagementBox 580, 1301SandvikaNorway",

The research approach adopts a process-based methodology and develops a theoretical basis on the cultural assumptions of technology which draws on technological frames and structural culture. The main body of the paper then describes and analyses the initiation, development and adoption challenges of the LIMNET EPS service. It is concluded that there are significant organizational and social issues which need to be addressed in the adoption of EPS across this market. Specifically, our analysis suggests that the low levels of EPS adoption are related to incongruences in the cultural assumptions held by key market participants in three domains: the nature of technological change, the nature of business transaction, and the importance of market institutions. Finally, we believe our theoretical basis may be valuable in research and practice to assist in the early identification of new evolving forms of electronic commerce.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",M I Barrett,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Barrett%2C+M+I,"Department of Accounting & MISFaculty of Business, University of AlbertaT6G 2R6EdmontonCanada",

It has developed the dimensions of temporality of business processes and applied them to describe and analyse temporal changes of export-related work in trading companies using EDI. In the departments studied, information technology transformed temporal profiles of work and also created a temporal symmetry between work groups interacting with each other. This result is compared with a previous study (Barley, 1988. In Making Time, Temple University Press). This temporal transformation of work by information technology has rarely been explored in information systems research as well as organizational studies. At this stage of research, it is difficult to decide which temporality, monochronicity or polychronicity, information technology facilitates, or whether information technology will always create temporal symmetry. More research on the relationship between time and information technology is required. Whatever temporal consequences of information technology are supported by future research, it is believed that this temporal consideration has value in information systems development and implementation. By taking into account polychronicity, monochronicity and temporal symmetry, we will be able to develop information systems which better fit users' temporal behaviour.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",H Lee,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Lee%2C+H,Department of Information Systems and ComputingBrunel UniversityUB8 3PHUxbridgeUK,

With the advent of a myriad of new and diverse technologies being introduced into contemporary organizations this work is only going to increase in its importance. Unfortunately, results of prior empirical work have been fragmented. Many of these studies treat IS innovations as homogeneous entities and do not effectively integrate notions of IS innovation with general organizational innovation. Swanson (1994) proposes a tri-core model and theory of IS innovation that can help integrate the isolated studies in this area, and can form the foundation on which future study of IS innovation can be based. This paper, in the spirit of a cumulative research tradition, presents and builds on Swanson's framework by incorporating contingencies that might affect the model. Specifically, notions of strategy (strategic push) and technology impact are discussed in the context of the framework. We hope that continued inquiry into this area will facilitate formulation of rich theory that will enable focused inquiry on IS innovation.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",V Grover,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Grover%2C+V,"Management Science DepartmentCollege of Business Administration, University of South Carolina29208ColumbiaSCUSA",

This problem can be attributed to the fact that many practitioners ignore the beneficial role of using such methodologies to both the quality of the end product and the economics of the development process. This paper, which is the second of a series, reports on a survey of information systems development practice carried out to provide evidence about the effect of using development methodologies on the economics of the development process. Data concerning 72 projects, obtained through a mail survey within the UK are analysed. The focus of the analysis is to provide evidence of how the use of methodologies affect economic parameters, such as time, cost, effort, number of people involved and outputs (in terms of requirements captured). The results show that the use of any methodology is generally proved to be a better option than using no methodology. However, the use of methodologies is not a panacea but specific methodologies can help towards achieving better results in specific areas.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",P D Chatzoglou,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Chatzoglou%2C+P+D,"Department of Public and Business AdministrationUniversity of Cyprus 75 Kallipoleos Str PO Box 537, CY1678NicosiaCyprus",

Often one system replaces several existing ones. Models of system evolution should therefore include these processes for all the systems being affected. Sometimes, the cumulative effect of small improvements made during adaptive maintenance was dysfunctional; for example, recurrent changes produced spaghetti code which no one dared to change. Possible negative effects of many small changes can be foreseen through improved planning and organization of maintenance. This indicates that systems should be replaced before they deteriorate through amendments. Replacement seems to be easier to carry out than initial development, due to easier requirements engineering. In fifteen out of sixteen processes where computer systems were replaced with newer ones, the new systems were replicas of the old systems with some functionality added. Through repeated replacements, the organizational structure is reinforced. Repeated replacements may therefore result in an inefficient and rigid organization in the long run. Thus many easy-to-accomplish replacements of program code, each of which were intended to improve efficiency, may cause the counter result in the end.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",J J Kaasbøll,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Kaasb%C3%B8ll%2C+J+J,"Peninsula School of Computing and Information Technology, Monash University McMahons Road, Frankston 3199VictoriaAustralia",

The idea that information is a corporate resource is now something more than business school hype. But the implications of sharing data are only just dawning on the corporate mind. How do managers interpret data? Where decision making is carried out by several people, perhaps in several different locations for different purposes the same data is used in multiple decision contexts. This paper explores the role of context as a way of adding value to information from databases. Two types of context are defined and discussed in relation to some examples of decisions where the role of context is vital.

Subjects were factored by development methodology (structured vs rapid prototyping), knowledge representation scheme used (rule-based vs hybrid) and programmer quality (naive vs experienced). The major finding is that an appropriate mix of development methodology, knowledge representation and personnel is necessary. No single development methodology or knowledge representation scheme is best, and a considerable number of interactions was observed in the experiment. Rapid prototyping combined with rule-based representation produced the best external quality in terms of functionality, but when combined with hybrid representation produced the worst. Similarly, rapid prototyping combined with hybrid representation produced the worst usability. Programmer quality had a positive effect on coding productivity, which in turn resulted in an increase in system usability. As with conventional software, increasing programmer quality can be very beneficial to both process and content. The study presented provides some evidence of the anomalies that are generated in the course of system development, and how they relate to internal quality. As might be expected, experienced programmers produced significantly fewer anomalies.

Programmer quality had a positive effect on coding productivity, which in turn resulted in an increase in system usability. As with conventional software, increasing programmer quality can be very beneficial to both process and content. The study presented provides some evidence of the anomalies that are generated in the course of system development, and how they relate to internal quality. As might be expected, experienced programmers produced significantly fewer anomalies. A relationship was found between internal quality and usability, but not functionality.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",RM O'Keefe,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/O%27Keefe%2C+RM,"Computer Science & Information Systems, Brunel UniversityUxbridgeUK",

However, the concept of criticality as widely used in common parlance tends to be metaphorical – the meaning of the term is loosely defined and the interpretation of the meaning is dependent upon the individual. To advance our knowledge of criticality and CSFs, the metaphorical use of the concept of criticality has to be formalised in a model by defining criticality and discriminating between different types of the same. The tacit knowledge of practitioners and researchers about criticality has to be explicated. This paper proposes a taxonomy of critical success factors in an attempt to formalise the concept. The proposed taxonomy is based on four levels of criticality and three sets of dichotomous attributes. The four levels of criticality in descending order of strength are: factors linked to success by a known causal mechanism; factors necessary and sufficient for success; factors necessary for success; and factors associated with success. The three sets of dichotomous attributes are: standing/instigating; direct/indirect; and enhancing/inhibiting. The taxonomy provides a framework for systematically classifying CSFs extant in literature and practice. Such classification will reveal the nature, extent, and sources of biases in the CSFs literature, if any, and help in correcting the biases if necessary and possible. The taxonomy can also be used to structure methodologies for eliciting CSFs, and thus ensure that the factors elicited are unbiased and complete.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",JJ Williams,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Williams%2C+JJ,"School of Business, University of Southern Indiana 8600 University Blvd IN 47712EvansvilleUSA",

Email research is part of a wider field, computer-mediated communication (CMC), which includes some areas not covered here, such as the Internet, video conferencing and EDI. Most research on email has concerned itself with the issues of media choice and media effects. Despite a great deal of published work though, the field still has an unsatisfactory, piecemeal feel to it. Much of the work that has been published is unsatisfactory in being based upon unrealistic, laboratory-like simulations, and a positivist epistemology. Most of the work concerns the use of email and the effects of using email on individuals and groups; little has been done on the effects at an organizational level.

Similarly in the public sector, the introduction of market testing and compulsory competitive tendering (CCT) will inevitably lead to the contracting-out of significant levels of IT work. This may lead to the demise of some public sector IT departments where external bids are favoured over those offered by the in-house team. This paper is divided into two sections. First, it considers some of the relevant literature on IT outsourcing in both private and public sector British and American organizations. It draws together important themes which explain the attraction of IT outsourcing to senior executives. Second, it introduces the results from a questionnaire survey of nearly 200 UK private and public sector organizations on IT outsourcing. In particular it looks at the proportion of organizations that claims to use outsourcing, how contracts are negotiated and the type of IT solutions preferred by IT managers. The central argument is that IT outsourcing poses significant challenges to both private and public sector organizations and is not simply a quick-fix panacea. Moreover, public sector IT managers would do well to analyse some of the less favourable reports from private sector outsourcing as they gear themselves up for CCT in the months ahead.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",W.L.

KBS and IS development methodologies are generally examined in terms of their similarities and differences. There is divergence at the feasibility and analysis stages, convergence at the design and coding stages, divergence during testing, convergence at the implementation stage, and divergence during maintenance. There are more similarities than there are differences between IS and KBS methodologies, particularly during the strategic planning stage. It is argued that linking KBS strategic planning to the planning element of an IS methodology will go further towards ensuring that the whole of the business is considered, leading to better integrated IS/KBS solutions. Application selection activities of two well-known KBS methodologies are briefly analysed. We show that these activities, which precede the feasibility study, do not consider the strategic aspects of the use of KBS (and IS in general) in business organizations. It is argued that a KBS strategy should be formulated in relation to the IS strategy and the business strategy, therefore increasing the convergence between IS and KBS methodologies.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",N.N.

This paper studies the impact of demographic variables such as education and experience, CASE adoption process variables such as training and participation, and CASE product variables such as perceived trialability, perceived complexity, perceived demonstrability and perceived compatibility on CASE effectiveness perceptions such as relative advantage, quality and productivity of systems development and work unit effects. Results based on a survey of 105 individual CASE users show that these effectiveness criteria are highly intercorrelated and that CASE experience, participation in CASE selection and implementation, perceived quality and quantity of training, and especially perceived complexity affect CASE effectiveness perceptions.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",J.

Specifically, the knowledge transfer effectiveness of seven information sources and channels is assessed. CASE innovation behaviour is modelled using three stages: initiation, adoption and implementation. Three types of CASE innovations are examined: two technical process innovations and one administrative innovation. Data for the empirical study were collected through a large-scale national survey of senior IS managers. A total of 405 usable responses were received. The perceived knowledge transfer effectiveness of the information sources and channels is associated differently with the initiation, adoption and implementation phases of the innovation process. Further, these associations are not uniform across the three categories of CASE innovations. The study has implications for how knowledge barriers can be alleviated during the CASE diffusion process.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",A Rai,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Rai%2C+A,"Department of Management and Pontikes Center for the Management of InformationCollege of Business and Administration, Southern Illinois UniversityIL 62901CarbondaleUSA",

A set of criteria is used to establish practitioner perceptions concerning the usability of data models within the analysis process. The findings provide evidence that practitioners do not understand some key semantic constructs and perceive that other analysts and clients have an incomplete understanding of available model semantics.

But the returns from different types of application vary both in terms of the ability to provide straightforward measurement of the costs and benefits, and in the degree of certainty with which estimates of costs and benefits will be realised. This paper provides a framework for classifying applications in the form of an eight-rung ladder, each rung of which represents a class of application. The way in which applications need to be handled and the methods by which their impact can be evaluated changes from rung to rung. Moving up the ladder increases the complexity of evaluation and the degree of risk and uncertainty, but at the same time also increases the potential returns on the investments. The ladder is different from conventional ‘strategic IT’ frameworks: it is a framework for action as well as understanding; it specifically relates to evaluation; and it does not imply any predetermined or time-based sequence of progress.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",D.

The benefits are related to the ease with which computer images can be manipulated. The paper argues that the benefits follow from three underlying factors. Cognitive and social processes, and specific, grounded decision situations are not well understood. Acceptable computer support embeds an appropriate manipulable formalism, and avoids the temptation to try to represent social process and situations. This enables participants to construct their own local processes and representations, and then to reconstruct them as needed. The potential of such support is to encourage participants in discussions and meetings to gain greater control over the local synthetic a priori (framework, protocols and procedures) within which their work takes place.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",M.

Although this importance of telecommunication links with customers and suppliers is widely recognised, there has been little empirical research on the factors that may affect the use of telecommunication-based IOS. In this paper we investigate the effects of four key factors – environmental uncertainty, product information intensity, value chain information intensity and information system (IS) maturity – on the use of telecommunication links with customers and suppliers, and the impact such links have on organizational performance. Nine hypotheses relating these antecedent variables to the use and impact of interorganizational telecommunication links are proposed.

This is true both for manufacturing industries and service industries. The existing literature on IT investment and organizational strategic performance, however, provides very little evidence linking IT investment to organizational strategic and economic performance. The present research investigates whether certain IT investment measures are useful in differentiating organizational economic performance among the most effective information technology users. Eight measures were used to represent IT investment. Ten ratios were utilised to measure organizational strategic and economic performance. The sample organizations were analysed using multidimensional cluster analysis. The results of the analysis suggest that a clear distinction exists between organizations in terms of IT investment and organizational strategic and economic performance. This is true even among the most effective users of information technology. The results also suggest that the majority of the organizations that are investing more in IT seem to be achieving superior strategic and economic performance.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",M.

The aim is to provide a solid basis to decide trade-offs between varying levels of quality to be achieved and limited resources to be employed. In the present context, the approach is applied to justify and to prioritise a growing class of IT investments: systems designed to implement quality, effectiveness and strategic business vision. Companies report that purely accounting-based methods are unable to cope with these kinds of investments and that a change in investment appraisal procedures is now needed to complement financial approaches, with quality-based approaches to support the decision-making process in relation to sophisticated IT. Based on research projects at the Kobler Unit, Imperial College, where data was collected on the relative success of new IT initiatives, and in collaboration with several large companies, quality engineering has been further developed into four modules, to be applied iteratively: quality standards (QS), quality awareness (QA), quality performance indicators (QPI) and quality value (QV). Compared to traditional accounting-based frameworks, quality engineering places a new emphasis on critical success factors, structured awareness raising exercises, measurable performance indicators, distinguishing between primary systems objectives and their inevitable second-order effects, risk assessment, and strategic business integration.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",B.

However, many real-life decision tasks are novel, unstructured and consequential. To support these tasks, expert systems are needed which provide an integrated environment capable of capturing new knowledge by updating the existing knowledge base. This paper describes the incremental development process of an expert system, from the initial gathering of data up to the development of knowledge acquisition tools and knowledge integration methodologies. The expert system developed addresses managerial planning tasks of Greek small-to-medium sized enterprises (SMEs).

However, many real-life decision tasks are novel, unstructured and consequential. To support these tasks, expert systems are needed which provide an integrated environment capable of capturing new knowledge by updating the existing knowledge base. This paper describes the incremental development process of an expert system, from the initial gathering of data up to the development of knowledge acquisition tools and knowledge integration methodologies. The expert system developed addresses managerial planning tasks of Greek small-to-medium sized enterprises (SMEs). The manager sets values for parameters specifying environmental and company characteristics. The expert system responds with suggestions on feasible tactics, objectives and strategies.

The study reported in this paper developed a method whereby the major elements of a data model can be consistently represented whatever process was originally used for modelling. This was achieved through reverse-engineering a logical relational schema from the record design. The reverse-engineering process attempted to identify the primary meaningful primitives of a data model in order to track changes to them in different iterations of the application. The stability data collection process was applied to a case study followed by a series of models to generate further data. The early evidence indicated that data model instability has it roots in errors in modelling, errors in the semantic analysis whether done consciously or intuitively, and in changes to the requirements brought on by changes to the ‘reality’. This research suggested that some of the elements of a data model are significantly more important than others. The results of the analysis demonstrated that data models are not nearly as stable as the literature might indicate. The work suggested that there should be greater concentration on the question of data model evolvability, and on the appropriate preservation of meaning across model versions, rather than on data model stability.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",S.

In order to facilitate the conjunctive use of these two qualitative approaches to social phenomena, GT is first re-interpreted through the perception filter of systems thinking. The two techniques are then subjected to analysis in terms of their ontological, epistemological and research design assumptions, from which it is concluded that there are no insurmountable barriers to their combined use. A further series of potential objections to grounding soft systems research as proposed in this paper are then raised and dealt with. Finally, it is concluded that while grounding soft systems research is in theory at least highly intuitively appealing, empirical research using the techniques in the way recommended here is required before the utility of the proposal can be ascertained with any degree of certainty.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",A.

The usual methods of implementing such a structure are either to compress the hierarchy into one table or to represent it by means of a separate table for each class and subclass in the hierarchy. However, both techniques are accompanied by specific problems which become unacceptable for hierarchies that are structurally unstable, have many subclasses and/or use specialising attributes applying to several of the subclasses.

Hypertext uses a browsing rather than a searching strategy and hypertext systems have found applications in a number of diverse areas. One of the strengths of using a hypertext system is the freedom it gives to users in the choice of information they wish to see, but this is also one of its drawbacks. This paper examines the effectiveness of hypertext as a way of retrieving information and reviews conventional information retrieval techniques which are the alternative strategy. Previous attempts at combining information retrieval and hypertext are considered and a prototype system outlined which has been developed to generate guided tours for users, to direct them through a hypertext to information they have requested. Finally, how adding this kind of intelligent guidance to a hypertext system would affect its usability as an information system is discussed.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",A.

The analysis is based on a distinction between the ontology, epistemology, methodology and ethics of the research. Ontology, forming the major constituent, is decomposed into five dimensions based on the major objects of IS research: the view of information/data, the view of the information/data system, the view of human beings, the view of technology, and the view of organizations and society. While the results of the analysis indicate certain variations between schools, especially in their ontological assumptions, all seven schools have quite similar assumptions. These are dominated by the view of information/data as descriptive facts, an information system as a technical artefact with social implications, a view of technology as a matter of human choice, predominantly a structural view of organizations, postivistic epistemology, a means-end-oriented view of IS science, and values of IS research reflecting organizational and economic goals; and most of these also have user-oriented criteria. In the case of the view of human beings and research methods it is not possible to identify any clear, dominant views. These assumptions are largely consistent with each other and provide support for the alleged existence of an identifiable ‘orthodoxy’ in IS research.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",J.

A dozen generic problems with these strategic information systems frameworks (SIS frameworks) are described, including the following. Most SIS frameworks are American in origin (and hence may be culturally bound). Since there are a large number of frameworks in existence, each is at best a relative version of the truth. Also because of the variety it may be costly to find an appropriate framework, and even more costly to find an inappropriate one. SIS frameworks are mostly post hoc applications of general strategic frameworks and so do not incorporate any special features of the computer world which might not have been apparent when the frameworks were devised. It is argued that SIS frameworks are externally imposed meanings and will stifle creativity by focusing attention away from bright ideas generated internally, will create the conditions for a power struggle for that meaning, and tend to move the locus of control for SISs outside the company. Finally, even the simplest framework may be understood in more than one way, creating the possibility of further hidden divisions.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",J.

However, the authors suggest that there is one area in which a computer-based version of SSM may be useful. This paper describes an exploratory study of the application of expert system technology as an aid to teaching SSM.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",Edgar A Whitley,https://www.tandfonline.com/author/Whitley%2C+Edgar+A,London School of Economics,

The results of an exploratory survey of 66 small business organizations show that small businesses have often been disappointed with their software packages. The disappointment is frequently a result of the inability of the package to adapt to the needs of the company, especially in small businesses of more than 50 employees. For small businesses of less than 20 employees the packages are too difficult to use. These findings indicate that small businesses should place more emphasis on the acquisition, especially the requirements specification, and developers should improve user-friendliness, the quality of support and documentation to fulfil the needs of the smallest of small businesses.

Although it is prescriptive to some extent, MERISE permits the participation of end users and senior management as well as data processing professionals in its decision cycle.

Following this definition we exploit the potential of using the object-oriented and knowledge representation techniques for modelling each of the three domains using evidence from real-world applications.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",G.

It argues that although decision making is of great relevance to the study of information systems insufficient attention has been given to the models by which IS professionals understand the process. Hard systems thinking has made a great contribution to IS in providing rational models of decision making, the work of H. A. Simon having been particularly influential; but the simplistic way in which such work is presented in IS texts ignores the role of social and political factors in decision making and imposes constraints in the complex social situations in which real world decision making occurs. An important contribution which the soft strand of systems thinking may make to IS is to provide a richer understanding of the nature of decision making through Vickers' concept of appreciation. The resultant ‘appreciative model’ of decision making emphasises the importance of the decision makers' perception of the organization and its situation in the interpretation of data, provides the basis for making a clear distinction between ‘data’ and ‘information’, and has implications for the ways in which computerized information systems are developed.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",P.

Increasingly these are taking the form of networks, with electronic links forwards to customers, backwards to suppliers and sideways to business partners. These networks are becoming global, bringing together all those who wish to contribute a proportion of their time to a particular mission. The staff of the network organization need to be supported by a communications network that is itself flexible and adaptable, and able to facilitate multifunctional, multi-location and multi-national team working. In the main the major constraints concern people, their skills and attitudes, and the management of technology, rather than the technology itself. IT professionals, and particularly IT directors, are sought who are able to facilitate change. IT directors require directional qualities which are distinct from those demanded of managers. They need a broad, strategic awareness and perspective concerning the requirements for responsive organizations, with continuing processes for adaptation and learning to meet the changing needs of customers.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",C.

This paper presents evidence to suggest that, so far, identification and successful implementation of strategic information systems has arisen as often as not from happy circumstance rather than as a result of a process of strategy formulation. Because of this, many companies run the risk of missing out on an opportunity to compete on an equal footing with their international rivals in increasingly competitive and global markets. In addition, the paper warns that the process of identifying and implementing strategically significant information systems is a complex task, the result of which represents considerable risk to companies should there be inadequate preparedness on their part. In view of this, it presents guidelines which may help in improving management understanding of the process; deciding on an appropriate information systems strategy for a particular company/context, and successfully implementing strategic information systems. A contingent, socio-technical approach to strategic information systems planning is proposed.","['information system (IS) use', 'enterprise resource planning (ERP)', 'theory of reasoned action (TRA)']",R.
