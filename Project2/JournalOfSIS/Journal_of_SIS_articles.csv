We posit that a more powerful CEO more effectively directs risky digital innovation, leads change management, and resolves conflicts within a firm’s digital and business sides. We find that a more powerful CEO can drive digital innovation to a greater extent. Interestingly, this relationship is weakened by a board of directors’ external social capital but strengthened by the board’s internal social capital.

Practitioner and academic research points to the crucial role of formal communication in the success of technology implementation. We developed a scale for measuring formal communication quality and assessed its influence using three samples of working professionals who were anticipating new technologies at work. Informed by the coping model of user adaptation, we examined the direct and indirect effects of formal communication quality during the anticipation stage of a technology implementation project on employees’ cognitions, emotions and intention to connect with colleagues in order to prepare themselves for the new technologies. The results validate our conceptualization of formal communication as a second-order formative construct with information quality in four content areas (i.e., what, how, why and when) as the first-order dimensions. Our findings affirm the role of formal communication as a managerial influence mechanism that positively affects an employee’s preliminary evaluation of a new IT during the anticipation stage. The evaluation of the new IT triggered emotions, and the emotions in turn motivated employees to seek opinions and camaraderie from others as a means of adapting to the new IT. Our post hoc analyses illustrate the dynamic nature of the relationship among formal communication quality, beliefs, emotions and coping intentions as the implementation unfolds. Our work contributes to the literature by improving the operationalization of formal communication quality, expanding the current understanding of seeking social support and revealing new insight about the temporal dynamics of the relationships in the nomological network during the anticipation stage.

Results from a study of 303 business unit operations of manufacturing organizations show that integration within business units and with outside partners is positively associated with process coupling of the value chain, both internally and externally. Further, both types of integration are positively associated with knowledge flow within and outside the business unit.

Practically, analytics projects may require managers to rethink project management practices and business unit’s and IT department’s roles in analytics projects.",[],Timothy R.

It commences from the viewpoint that Information Systems (IS) research benefits from being strategic at every level, from individual researcher, to research program, to research discipline and beyond. It particularly advocates for more coordinated programs of research emphasising real-world impact, while recognising that vibrant, individual-driven and small-team research within broad areas of promise, is expected to continue forming the core of the IS research ecosystem. Thus, the overarching aim is the amplification of strategic thinking in IS research – the further leveraging of an orientation natural to the JSIS community, with emphasis on research programs as a main strategic lever, and further considering how JSIS can be instrumental in this aim.",[],Guy G.

The special issue commences with an incisive and compelling editorial by the special issue editors, “Digital Work and Organisational Transformation: Emergent Digital/Human Work Configurations in Modern Organisations,” that synthesizes the four empirical articles in the special issue. They highlight the challenges for organisations in dealing with “third order change, particularly because these effects are beyond existing frames of reference and require a more dynamic and supple response based on the values, purpose and intent dominant in the organisation.” They refer to this as structural digital work, and further reflect on the value of current theories and methods to research this emergent phenomenon. The ideas in this special issue have much wider pertinence than might be anticipated. It is highly timely in the face of COVID-19. I encourage all to peruse the special issue editorial, which I have no doubt will further invite attention to the special issue component papers.",[],,g.gable@qut.edu.au,

Through strategic signaling, journal lists are performative and have the potential to shape and constrain research activity. Given the strategic and performative role of journal lists, it is important that the journals that constitute those lists have substantial impact. To measure the scholarly impact of journals we propose a new measure, the HMJ index, which comprises an equally-weighted combination of journal H-index, median citations per article, and Journal Impact Factor (JIF).

Generally missing from such analysis, however, is any consideration of data themselves. What is it that is having these effects? In this Viewpoint article I therefore present a critical analysis of a number of widely-held assumptions about data in general and big data in particular. Rather than being a referential, natural, foundational, objective and equal representation of the world, it will be argued, data are partial and contingent and are brought into being through situated practices of conceptualization, recording and use. Big data are also not as revolutionary voluminous, universal or exhaustive as they are often presented. Some initial implications of this reconceptualization of data are explored. A distinction is made between “data in principle” as they are recorded, and the “data in practice” as they are used. It is only the latter, typically a small and not necessarily representative subset of the former, that will contribute directly to the effects of datafication.",[],Matthew Jones,m.jones@jbs.cam.ac.uk,"Judge Business School, University of Cambridge, Trumpington Street, Cambridge CB2 1AG, UK"

Many of these relationships are strategic, in the sense that they are large, underpin clients’ business strategies, and the client can become highly dependent on service provider capabilities and performance. The BSO market is over $1 trillion in size and has been growing for two decades. Despite the size and maturity, up to 50% of BSO relationships result in poor outcomes, partly because partners cannot resolve conflicts. Based on interviews with client and provider leads from 13 BSO relationships, we answered the research question: “What types of inter-organizational conflicts arise in BSO relationships and how do partners resolve them?” We extended the prior literature on inter-organizational conflict frameworks by conceptualizing three types of conflicts specific to BSO: commercial conflicts, service conflicts, and relationship conflicts. Conflicts as we study them here are not minor disagreements, but have a strategic dimension. Commercial conflicts were the most serious because outsourcing relationships are firstly commercial transactions—a provider must earn a profit and a client must meet its economic business case to be viable. Theoretically, we found Thomas and Kilmann’s typology of conflict resolution styles to be robust enough to characterize the BSO conflict cases, provided a switched style category was included. In our data, we found that only the collaborative and switched-to-collaborative styles resolved conflicts to the satisfaction of both partners, which is consistent with theory. Novel findings that extend or contest prior theory are identified as part of a future research agenda. For practitioners, we also identified five effective conflict resolution behaviors.",[],Mary Lacity,Mary.Lacity@umsl.edu,"College of Business, University of Missouri-St. Louis, United States"

Indeed, most outsourcing suppliers have delivered IT operational and business process innovation to client firms; however, achieving strategic innovation through outsourcing has been perceived to be far more challenging. Building on the growing interest in the IS outsourcing literature, this paper seeks to advance our understanding of the role that relational and contractual governance plays in achieving strategic innovation through outsourcing. We hypothesized and tested empirically the relationship between the quality of client–supplier relationships and the likelihood of achieving strategic innovation, and the interaction effect of different contract types, such as fixed-price, time and materials, partnership and their combinations. Results from a pan-European survey of 248 large firms suggest that high-quality relationships between clients and suppliers may indeed help achieve strategic innovation through outsourcing.

However, a tension exists between the user’s desire to protect personal information and the needs of online businesses for consumer data that drive customer relationship and business intelligence applications. This study explores the roles of positive and negative affect on users’ trust and privacy beliefs that relate to the online disclosure of personal information. A model is tested using the responses of 301 Internet users who visited one of two commercial websites. The results indicate that positive affect has a significant effect on users’ website trust and privacy beliefs that motivate online information disclosure and this effect is more pronounced for users with high Internet security concerns. The idea that positive mood-inducing website features can motivate user behavior has the potential to guide the development of websites for effective information disclosure and data collection.",[],Robin Wakefield,robin_wakefield@baylor.edu,"Information Systems, Baylor University, One Bear Place #98005, Waco, TX 76798, United States"

In this paper, we develop a theoretical model to explore the contextual and causal factors of project attractiveness in inducing activities such as source code contribution, software maintenance, and usage. We test our model with data derived from more than 4000 projects spanning 4 years. Our main findings include that projects’ set of conditions such as license restrictiveness and their available resources provide the context that directly influence the amount of work activities observed in the projects. It was also found that indirect and unintended contributions such as recommending software, despite of being non-technical, cannot be ignored for project activeness, diffusion and sustainability. Finally, our analysis provide evidence that higher attractiveness leads to more code-related activities with the downside of slowing down responsiveness to address projects’ tasks, such as the implementation of new features and bug fixes.

The extensions consist of (i) a formalization using the Hybrid Probabilistic Relational Model formalism, (ii) an implementation in an analysis tool for enterprise architecture and (iii) a data collection approach using expert assessments collected via interviews and questionnaires. The accuracy and cost effectiveness of the method was tested empirically by comparing it with direct performance measurements of five services of a geographical information system at a Swedish utility company. The tests indicate that the proposed method can be a viable option for rapid service response time estimates when a moderate accuracy within 15% is sufficient.",[],Nicholas Honeth,N/A,"Industrial Information and Control Systems, Osquldas v. 12, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden"

The paper concludes that broker-provided value-added ‘orchestration’ services need to enable knowledge mobility and appropriability, and to ensure that ‘unsuccessful’ innovation seekers and providers appropriate sufficient value to participate again.",[],Philip O’Reilly,Philip.oreilly@ucc.ie,"Department of Accounting, Finance and Information Systems, University College Cork, Ireland"

In Korea, however, the online music business (including mobile and fixed-internet) is dominated by mobile carriers and has replaced offline businesses, which has caused disruptive changes in the music industry structure.

Previous approaches included centrally managed, proprietary knowledge repositories, often involving structured and controlled search and access. Today the trend is toward knowledge management by social software, which provides open and inexpensive alternatives to traditional implementations. While social software carries great promise for knowledge management, this also raises fundamental questions about the very essence and value of firm knowledge, the possibility for knowledge protection, firm boundaries, and the sources of competitive advantage.

In addition to responding to the rapidly evolving underlying technologies, ISS practice in organisations has had to deal with the combined effects of economic cycles and an increasingly global business context, which effect both the organisations themselves and the development of the IT industry. This article argues that the changing fortunes of the IT suppliers and their strategies are two of the most significant influences on organisations’ ISSs. The influence and contribution of academics and their research is also discussed. The study of ISS has largely followed practice and attempted to explain its nature, role and impact using contemporary theoretical paradigms but often based on relatively limited empirical data. In conclusion it is suggested that a new multi-centred, collaborative approach, involving both academic and practitioner experts to develop a comprehensive evidence base, would enable greater understanding of how the range of factors interact to determine the nature and value of ISS in 21st century organisations.",[],John M.

To that end, multinational corporations (MNCs) are asking their IT departments to support both the exploitation of existing knowledge and the unit-to-unit transfer of new know-how derived in units from exploration. Nonetheless, new know-how derived from exploratory research, development and experience in one unit can be difficult to transfer to units that can exploit that know-how to commercial ends. The factors that impede the transfer of new know-how have been conceptualized as “factors of stickiness”. In this paper, we present a theoretical model of organizational factors that can cause (or conversely mitigate) stickiness in the flow of new know-how between MNC units.

Furthermore, little empirical evidence exists regarding IT assets’ business value. In light of this paucity, this paper makes several contributions to IS research and practice. First, it advances the BVIT literature by empirically testing a model that traces a path from IT assets through IT-enabled resources to firm performance. Second, it extends the BVIT and resource-based view (RBV) literatures by explicating and testing the impact of a firm’s external environment on its IT-enabled resources. Third, it builds on recent literature to argue for, and test, two distinct forms of firm-level outcome: operational and strategic benefits. Finally, the paper contributes to managers’ and IS practitioners’ knowledge by demonstrating the transformative capacity of IT assets on the strategic potential of organizational resources.

Furthermore, little empirical evidence exists regarding IT assets’ business value. In light of this paucity, this paper makes several contributions to IS research and practice. First, it advances the BVIT literature by empirically testing a model that traces a path from IT assets through IT-enabled resources to firm performance. Second, it extends the BVIT and resource-based view (RBV) literatures by explicating and testing the impact of a firm’s external environment on its IT-enabled resources. Third, it builds on recent literature to argue for, and test, two distinct forms of firm-level outcome: operational and strategic benefits. Finally, the paper contributes to managers’ and IS practitioners’ knowledge by demonstrating the transformative capacity of IT assets on the strategic potential of organizational resources. Empirically, the paper develops and employs valid and reliable scales to test the research model using survey data on IT-enabled customer service departments.

Thus, a new breed of IS—Green IS—emerged in recent years. This paper presents an integrative theoretical model that: (1) employs institutional theory to help explain how a range of exogenous regulative, normative and cultural-cognitive factors from the institutional environment and the organisational field influence IT manufacturers’ decisions on the design and manufacture of environmentally sustainable products; and (2) uses organisational theory to describe the strategic endogenous arrangements that organisations institute using Green IS in order to support sense-making, decision making and knowledge creation around environmental sustainability. The paper employs the findings of a case study of Compliance and Risks’ Ltd. Compliance-to-Product (C2P) application and its implementation in two US-based Fortune 500 IT manufacturers to help validate and refine the a priori theoretical model. The paper therefore makes a significant contribution to theory building on the phenomenon of Green IS, through its articulation of empirically-based theoretical propositions which employ conceptual mechanisms to explain how Green IS can support organisational sense-making, decision making and knowledge sharing and creation around the design and manufacture of Green IT.",[],Tom Butler,tbutler@afis.ucc.ie,"Department of Accounting, Finance and Information Systems, College of Business and Law, University College Cork, Cork City, Ireland"

A major gap that exists in the Green IT research literature today is the absence of a theoretical framework that can be used to assist organizations in assessing their potential for undertaking Green IT initiatives and implementing them via modern technological means such as virtualization. This study attempts to bridge this gap by developing and proposing an integrative framework which focuses on identifying and examining the factors that contribute to the assessment of a firm’s readiness to go green via IT-enabled virtualization. The framework is firmly grounded using three well-established IS theories: (a) technology-organization-environment, (b) process-virtualization, and (c) diffusion of innovation. It integrates these three theoretical lenses to utilize the strengths of each for assessing the potential for undertaking Green IT initiatives and the stages of Green IT implementation at the organizational level.

Based upon the gaps identified in the overview, I suggest some propositions for future IS culture research. Finally, I seek to identify important future research that lies at the intersection of globalization and culture research, namely research into global knowledge transparency. Global knowledge transparency involves the dual objectives of providing more detailed product and service information to the consumer and gathering more detailed knowledge about the individual. The former helps individuals make more responsible choices in their purchase decisions, enabling them to understand the consequences of their choices on the well-being of others. The latter helps individuals make more informed decisions concerning their own well-being, enabling them to better understand the consequences of their choices for their own life and health.

Drawing upon the knowledge-based view of the firm, this study postulates that, compared with IT outsourcing, IT insourcing is more effective for developing IT-enabled business processes (IEBP), which subsequently lead to superior firm performance. Our analysis of the data from InformationWeek and Compustat shows that IT insourcing is positively associated with IEBP, while the relationship between IT outsourcing and IEBP is not statistically significant. We also find that IEBP have a significant influence on firm performance. Finally, the effect of IT sourcing mechanisms on IEBP and the effect of IEBP on firm performance are both moderated by the type of innovation related to IEBP. The results suggest that in order to improve their performance firms should consider IT an integral part of their strategic core and should be proactively involved in the internal development of IT resources.

Taking a process view of outsourcing and drawing on the relational view of the firm, the framework identifies four high-level dimensions that correspond to an organization’s resource position in four key areas: organizational IT value position, organizational IT asset position, relational asset position, and relational capability position. A novel structured method is used to identify the congruent outsourcing configurations within the range of possible outsourcing configurations based on the interdependencies among the four dimensions. Three congruent outsourcing configurations, designated asset dependence, relational dependence, and independence, emerge from this analysis. Drawing on the assumptions of configurational theory about organizational change and taking a dynamic perspective, the framework is extended to describe how organizations transition between outsourcing configurations over time. This paper demonstrates how a configurational approach can address three potential problems of the outsourcing literature and advance outsourcing research.",[],Lior Fink,FinkL@bgu.ac.il,"Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, P.O.

While many studies have investigated mature EMPs and identified factors leading to their success and failure, few studies have investigated the capabilities necessary to develop successful EMPs. This research shares findings from in-depth case studies of two EMPs conducted over a 3-year period. Using the dynamic capabilities framework as a theoretical lens, this paper: (1) identifies the capabilities necessary to develop EMPs that generate and sustain participant contributions, and (2) discusses how to develop these capabilities. This study finds that the cultivation of a “trial-and-error” culture along with sales managers’ activities played key roles in developing outside-in and spanning capabilities. Taken together these capabilities helped the successful EMP develop entrepreneurial alertness and customer agility, two capabilities that were not developed in the failed EMP. These findings extend dynamic capabilities theory and may help practitioners better develop two-sided networks, such as EMPs, that require a critical mass of buyers and sellers.",[],Hope Koch,Hope_Koch@baylor.edu,"Information Systems Department, Baylor University, One Bear Place #98005, Waco, TX 76798-8005, United States"

This study questions this assumption by exploring how the taken for granted project’s boundaries are defined in practice. It investigates a case study of an ERP implementation project in an international organization. The findings show the busy multiple-projects platform of contemporary organizations that ERP project cannot be isolated from. They also reveal that project management boundaries are continually crossed and that project’s boundaries in practice are malleable and changeable. They are defined through negotiations with other projects and programs where what is inside or outside a project is subject to change according to the outcomes of such negotiations. A flatter view of project organizing could facilitate such an interaction.

Over the past years, two perspectives have become prevalent in organization science. The individualist perspective assumes the locus of knowledge is people who learn, and that knowledge cannot extend beyond the physical limits of human beings. The collectivist perspective assumes the locus of knowledge is collective. Collective entities accumulate knowledge through forms of social learning. Boundaries of knowledge are drawn around social entities—groups, communities, networks, and organizational units, etc. Recent work in management and organization science has accentuated the differences, and argued against the widespread adoption of a collectivist perspective. This argument holds implications for information systems research. The current paper reviews selected contributions on the locus of knowledge, presents an argument for a combined collectivist and individualist perspective, and outlines future directions for information systems research.

In the present study, we investigate a particular type of GDT working ‘around the clock’: the 24-h knowledge factory (Gupta, 2008). Adopting the productivity perspective on knowledge sharing (Haas and Hansen, 2005, Haas and Hansen, 2007), we hypothesize how a 24-h knowledge factory and a co-located team will differ in technology use, knowledge sharing processes, and performance. We conducted a quasi-experiment in IBM, collecting both quantitative and qualitative data, over a period of 12 months, on a GDT and a co-located team. Both teams were composed of the same number of professionals, provided with the same technologies, engaged in similar tasks, and given similar deadlines. We found significant differences in their use of technologies and in knowledge sharing processes, but not in efficiency and quality of outcomes. We show how the co-located team and the GDT enacted a knowledge codification strategy and a personalization strategy, respectively; in each case grafting elements of the other strategy in order to attain both knowledge re-use and creativity. We conclude by discussing theoretical contributions to knowledge sharing and GDT literatures, and by highlighting managerial implications to those organizations interested in developing a fully functional 24-h knowledge factory.",[],Joseph Broschak,broschak@email.arizona.edu,"Eller College of Management, University of Arizona, Arizona, United States"

Consequently, public sector organisations and private sector enterprises are offered little in the way of guidance in designing KMS from the bewildering range of information technologies said to capture, store, retrieve, transfer and apply knowledge. Action research, with its emphasis on praxis and on the importance of ‘situated, practical theory,’ is an ideal vehicle for deepening the IS field’s understanding of the design of IT-enabled Knowledge Management Systems for use in Government and Non-Government Organisations. This paper reports on the outcomes of two related participatory action research studies involving a University R&D team, practitioners from the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and a Government Department. The first of these studies focused on the design and development, using UNFPA practitioners’ practical theory, of a desktop-based IT artefact for knowledge sharing. The second action research study extends and applies the lessons learned from the first to develop an enterprise-wide core IT artefact for the Government Department’s Knowledge Management System. This paper contributes to both research and practice by: (1) offering a conceptual schema based on practical theory to inform the design and development of a core IT artefact for KMS and (2) describing the functions and features of a typical core IT artefact.

It evaluates the mobilization of knowledge in terms of the speed and the number of knowledge providers that are matched to a knowledge request. Hypotheses are proposed based on transaction costs imposed by the characteristics of knowledge. We also study the impact of safeguarding and coordination mechanisms that may help overcome challenges to PKE use. We find that knowledge mobilization in the PKE is adversely impacted by knowledge transfer costs due to the tacitness, situatedness, and complexity of knowledge that is sought. To a lesser extent, knowledge mobilization is adversely affected by the likelihood of opportunistic behavior as indicated by the reputation ratings of the individual requesting the knowledge. The study enables a better understanding of the factors impacting the effectiveness of personal knowledge exchanges and provides important managerial implications for shaping their development.",[],Sanjay Gosain,gosain@gmail.com,"Capital Group Companies, Inc., 15271 Laguna Canyon Blvd., Irvine, CA 92618, USA"

Yet, from an IT perspective, there is still some debate as to whether IT business value or the contribution of IT to firm performance is also maximized when firms maintain a single-focused strategy. Using the notion of value disciplines to model strategic foci, we find in a matched survey of executives in 241 firms that IT business value is highest in firms with a multi-focused business strategy and lowest in those with a single focus. We also find a relationship between strategic foci and the primary locus of IT value within the value chain for all focus-types except those emphasizing operational excellence.

However, there is evidence of a gap between SISP research and practice. Taking this situation as a motivation, we conducted an in depth case study on SISP to investigate this gap. The study was carried out in a German financial services company (FSC) over a period of five months in summer 2003. During this time, the enterprise situation and the information system (IS) practices situation of FSC were studied with respect to the SISP approach in place. Our findings confirm the hypothesis that practitioners largely ignore academic literature and do not use it in support of their SISP endeavours. This is all the more striking since FSC extensively used guidance from IS research in other fields such as systems analysis and software development. Our case study examines in detail two possible explanations for the gap: firstly a lacking transfer of academic knowledge to practice, and secondly deficiencies in the academic knowledge base itself. In fact, our observations highlight a disconnect between academic discussion and practical conduct. However, we found that the ignorance of academic literature on SISP is not primarily caused by a constrained knowledge transfer. In order to exclude communication barriers, we filtered the academic discussion according to the specific situation and the needs of FSC and translated it into practical recommendations. Nevertheless, the academic arguments we put forward hardly had any impact, either on IT managers’ thinking or on SISP practice at FSC. Though academic literature was partly perceived as inspiring, it was not regarded as a touchstone for SISP practice. Academia, in the eyes of FSC’s practitioners, ignores the “real problems” and thus is not accredited as a relevant source of advice. Moreover, in a final discussion with FSC’s senior IT executives we got the impression that the professional identity of FSC’s IT management – and more specifically the CIO’s role – was different from interpretations prevalent in academia. The academic discussion assumes the CIO to be an initiator of organisational innovations and driver of business strategy on the board. In contrast, we found that FSC’s CIO basically perceives her role as that of a service provider to business. While the different perceptions might be due to idiosyncrasies of FSC, related research provided additional empirical support for the conjecture of misleading academic assumptions about the role of IT management in practice.",[],R.A.

Next, it traces the evolution of the IS application portfolio in each of the studied firms and analyses accompanying changes in strategic and organizational factors. The paper builds on IS assimilation studies in organizations from developed societies, and describes issues unique to IS assimilation in Indian firms. It is based on data collected from case studies of IS deployment in nine Indian organizations.",[],Sanjiv D.

This paper addresses two important, though neglected, strands of the modernisation agenda, evidence-based policy and partnership work. The development of a Geographical Information System (known as MADE) to support multi-agency collaboration is described in the domain of crime reduction. The application of MADE to support policy work is contrasted in two local partnership contexts: the statutorily constituted Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership, and an ad hoc forum instigated by the police to address the specific issue of licensing reform and its impact on alcohol-related violence. Although the GIS infrastructure is the same, the manifestation of EBP was markedly different. This is interpreted in terms of differences in the situated micro-politics of the two settings. In the former, strong regulation by central government has “translated” MADE into a tool for generating performance targets and indicators. The second setting comes much closer to the true spirit of EBP, reflecting the greater autonomy of the network and the strong commitment both to evidence and partnership of its main player. In general, the findings demonstrate the importance of GIS to the policy process, particularly in the domain of multi-agency partnerships. There are a broad range of opportunities for IS research within the modernisation project. The need for ethnographic studies of change at a local level is highlighted, and for the adoption of a more critical stance than has been characteristic of mainstream eGovernment research to date.",[],David G.

They, however, face a dilemma when TCT and the RBV suggest different sourcing alternatives. The study identifies contexts where sourcing decisions made based on these two theories differ, and examines which theory accounts better for an organization's sourcing decisions. Results show that a high-specificity asset is a major driver of sourcing decisions. It overpowers the effects of uncertainty on sourcing decisions; while a non-strategic resource has no impact on sourcing decisions. In particular, where the two theories make conflicting predictions, organizations should not always outsource non-strategic resources. Non-strategic resources that involve high specificity should be retained internally.

Intuition, symbols, rituals, and ceremony all figured prominently in the decision process. However, rather than being in conflict with the rational processes, we found them to be in tension, leading to a more holistic social construction of decision processes.

Intuition, symbols, rituals, and ceremony all figured prominently in the decision process. However, rather than being in conflict with the rational processes, we found them to be in tension, leading to a more holistic social construction of decision processes.

While investments in IT continue to made for both efficiency and effectiveness purposes, the SIS era is premised on management proactively seeking out opportunities for competitive advantage through IT, with approaches to information systems (IS) strategy formulation accommodating the requirement for both alignment of IS/IT investments with corporate strategy and assessing the disruptive impact of technology and the options for its use in shaping business strategy. Frameworks, methodologies and tools have been developed to support the objectives of the SIS era, yet the mechanisms through which organizations achieve repeated and sustained value from IT has received scant attention. Drawing on resource-based theory, this paper proposes a perspective on the management of IT in organizations that specifically considers how organizations can continuously derive and leverage value through IT.

While investments in IT continue to made for both efficiency and effectiveness purposes, the SIS era is premised on management proactively seeking out opportunities for competitive advantage through IT, with approaches to information systems (IS) strategy formulation accommodating the requirement for both alignment of IS/IT investments with corporate strategy and assessing the disruptive impact of technology and the options for its use in shaping business strategy. Frameworks, methodologies and tools have been developed to support the objectives of the SIS era, yet the mechanisms through which organizations achieve repeated and sustained value from IT has received scant attention. Drawing on resource-based theory, this paper proposes a perspective on the management of IT in organizations that specifically considers how organizations can continuously derive and leverage value through IT.

First, we investigated the relationship between the level of AMT usage and the amount of information provided by management accounting information systems (MAISs). The results of this study showed a positive correlation between the AMT level and the amount of management accounting information (i.e. planning and control information, and nonfinancial performance information). A significant positive relationship between provision of information and improvement in production performance was also observed. This study also empirically examined the learning promoting effects of organizational facilitators, which is complemented and assisted by information technology. The empirical results demonstrated that facilitators of organizational learning have a moderating impact on the relationship between provision of information and performance improvement. Therefore, it is concluded that when learning facilitators are well arranged and highly utilized, a provision of information is more likely to be linked to effective learning and, consequently, improved performance.",[],Jong-min Choe,choejj@bh.kyungpook.ac.kr,"Department of Accounting, School of Business, Kyungpook National University, Buk-ku Sankyuk-dong 1370, Taegu 702-701, South Korea"

The dramatic advances of universal business computers overshadowed its history and foredoomed it as a product in the 1960s. LEO, however, embraced principles of business computing that were essentially different from those of the mass-marketed, universal computing products that have since dominated the business-computing marketplace. The defining LEO principle is that technology should be adapted to match the business, not that business should be adapted to match the technology. Because technology cannot be made-to-order economically, adaptation is required in practice, either by the customer or by the technology provider, or more probably, by both. Business organizations have to choose, therefore, from two essentially different philosophies: the introduction of technology easily by adopting a prefabricated solution (the mass-marketers), or the introduction of technology with potentially radical changes to optimize both the technology and the organization. The effect of the principle is illustrated with discussion of examples of optimization factors, processes and means developed during the LEO jubilee conference workshops.",[],Richard Baskerville,baskerville@acm.org,"Department of Computer Information Systems, Georgia State University, P.O.

Some time in the next two decades we will enter our fourth industrial era, fueled by evolution in power, genetics, space exploration and information technologies. Unlike other industrial revolutions, this will be attended by widespread consolidations in industries as diverse as utility, retail, pharmaceuticals as well as the government. The trade wing of the UN, the United Nations Trade Organization (UNTO) is established to deal with global issues. The UNTO passes a number of resolutions including # 1/10 which deals with a uniform system of personal identification for all individuals. Due to free trade facilitated by electronic bureaucracies and global transportation grids, GNP growth rates triple. However, the consolidations will lead to the disappearance of clerical, administrative and management employees, leaving only the top management and highly skilled professionals. These changes will result in companies outsourcing all their routine processing to transaction and data centres. Employees will work from well equipped IT centres. The internet is in its third incarnation and is supported by a comprehensive web intelligence to answer all possible questions. Other technological changes include Terahertz computers, Personal identification Devices (PID), AI chips and hierarchical databases with relational interfaces.

The adopters' fears can be understood by analyzing both reliability-related and value-oriented distrust. While technical remedies may reduce reliability-related distrust by removing adoption barriers and restoring online trust, they may still be ineffective in overcoming value-oriented distrust. To analyze value-oriented distrust within the context of e-marketplace adoption, it is essential to examine how a society's socio-cultural structure affects economic activities. An insight derived from this study is that when an e-marketplace is adopted, such adoption includes not only the use of technology but also the transfer of the embedded trust-production mechanisms as well as the transformation of economic assumptions and cultural beliefs about how a market system operates. As distrust is rooted in cultural beliefs persisting over generations, this requires us to be sensitive to the need to reduce value-oriented fears so as to maximize the possibility of e-marketplace acceptance.",[],Ruey-Lin Hsiao,rueylin@nus.edu.sg,"Department of Decision Sciences, NUS Business School, National University of Singapore, BIZ 2 Building (#03-14), 1 Business Link, Singapore, Singapore 117592"

It is our main thesis that if organizations focused more on implementing a sound IT governance strategy, it might help senior executives to manage not only the IT-related activities, but also the perceptions between IT and the rest of the organization, and, in doing so, foster a more successful IT organization. Using six case studies conducted within the oil and gas industry, we explore differences in perceptions toward IT and in the organization of IT activities. Using an Extended Platform Logic Perspective, we note differences and similarities between the firms, with respect to IT capabilities, relational and integration mechanisms, measures of success, and relationships with the business units. Our results suggest that our colleagues-in-practice have evolved from focusing on one-way architectures within a centralization/decentralization context toward a two-way relationship-oriented approach to managing the IT structure.

It is our main thesis that if organizations focused more on implementing a sound IT governance strategy, it might help senior executives to manage not only the IT-related activities, but also the perceptions between IT and the rest of the organization, and, in doing so, foster a more successful IT organization. Using six case studies conducted within the oil and gas industry, we explore differences in perceptions toward IT and in the organization of IT activities. Using an Extended Platform Logic Perspective, we note differences and similarities between the firms, with respect to IT capabilities, relational and integration mechanisms, measures of success, and relationships with the business units. Our results suggest that our colleagues-in-practice have evolved from focusing on one-way architectures within a centralization/decentralization context toward a two-way relationship-oriented approach to managing the IT structure.

This research examines how institution-based trust develops in online B2B marketplaces to facilitate interorganizational trust (buyers' trust in sellers). Building upon the notion of institutional trust [Zucker,1986], this study proposes how specific institution-based structures help engender interorganizational trust and indirectly influence transaction success in B2B marketplaces. Five specific institution-based mechanisms are proposed—perceived monitoring, perceived legal bonds, perceived accreditation, perceived feedback, and perceived cooperative norms. To assess the influence of the proposed two dimensions of interorganizational trust—credibility and benevolence—in buyer–seller relationships, three trust outcomes are examined—satisfaction, perceived risk, and continuity. The proposed model is tested on data from 102 organizational buyers in an online B2B marketplace. The results support the proposed model, delineating the relationship between institution-based trust and interorganizational trust. The study provides evidence on how specific institutional mechanisms build trust in online B2B marketplaces, stressing the ability of institution-based trust to build a trustworthy trading environment in the digital economy.

The method built on prior studies, developing approaches to alignment used with larger firms and integrating other concepts and measures from the small firm literature. Using a mail questionnaire, data from 250 firms was collected on nine strategy areas so that business and ITS responses could be compared. IT alignment was explored using both the matching and moderation approaches. The moderation approach appeared more effective in identifying IT alignment. The results indicated that a significant proportion of small firms had achieved high IT alignment. Furthermore, the group of small firms with high IT alignment had achieved better organisational performance than firms with low IT alignment.

This study focused on measuring the alignment of business strategy and IT strategy (ITS) among small UK manufacturing firms and then investigated the link between alignment and performance. The method built on prior studies, developing approaches to alignment used with larger firms and integrating other concepts and measures from the small firm literature. Using a mail questionnaire, data from 250 firms was collected on nine strategy areas so that business and ITS responses could be compared. IT alignment was explored using both the matching and moderation approaches. The moderation approach appeared more effective in identifying IT alignment. The results indicated that a significant proportion of small firms had achieved high IT alignment. Furthermore, the group of small firms with high IT alignment had achieved better organisational performance than firms with low IT alignment. This is consistent with findings in large firms and opens up possibilities for further study of IT alignment in small firms.",[],Malcolm King,m.king@lboro.ac.uk,"Business School, Loughborough University, Loughborough, Leicestershire LE11 3TU, UK"

It has been suggested that organisational agendas are built from talk at the interactional level (Boden, 1994), and this paper seeks to explore the relationship between social and organisational contexts and the process of early requirements gathering. Analysts and clients were asked about their aims, their professional role, and other issues that arose in their interactions with each other as part of a larger study in early requirements gathering. The paper discusses three themes from three case studies that can be seen to be embedded in the social and organisational context of early requirements gathering—how the issues to be discussed during the interaction were put forward, professional relationships, and the overall organisational context in which the interaction takes place. Some observations are made about the varying social and organisational contexts of early requirements gathering and the role of individual differences, and the possibility of using typical contexts as ‘repertoire building research’ (Schön, 1983) to flow into practice.",[],Cathy Urquhart,c.urquhart@auckland.ac.nz,"Department of Management Science and Information Systems, University of Auckland, Private Bag 92019, Auckland, New Zealand"

Enhancement of an organization's communication capabilities may influence performance through improved strategic decision making, better coordination of strategic actions and by facilitating learning from strategic initiatives. Accordingly, the paper investigates the effects of internal communication through use of computer networks, Intranet, and external communication via the Internet in association with autonomous and participatory strategic decision making approaches and strategic planning. These relationships are tested in two different industrial settings characterized by low and high levels of dynamism and complexity to assess possible environmental contingencies. In less dynamic and complex industries, the results show a positive association between Intranet use and innovation, while Internet use has a positive association to profitability and to innovation in organizations adhering to a participatory decision approach. In more dynamic and complex industries, Intranet use combined with an autonomous decision approach is associated with high profitability and sales growth, while Internet use combined with participatory decision making is associated with higher innovation. Hence, the study finds evidence that innovation relates to use of the Internet and participation across industries, and that economic efficiency relates to use of Intranet and autonomy in dynamic and complex industries.",[],Torben Juul Andersen,tanderse@som.gmu.edu,"School of Management, George Mason University, Enterprise Hall, MSN 5F5, Fairfax, VA 22030-4444, USA"

The paper develops an approach that reflects on the role of information as a strategic resource. It argues that ISS recommendations in small firms need to take account of organisational change issues as much as information system implementation. The revised approach to ISS for SMEs is demonstrated through its application to over 40 cases in the UK West Midlands. The influences from the processes on outcomes are discussed and the effectiveness of tools and techniques recommended is assessed.",[],P.

Systems tend to be fragmented, untidy and unpredictable, often turning the designers’ setting and practice into a “swamp”. Drawing on stories of system development projects the author highlights the role of transient constructs as dynamic carriers of knowledge and effective vehicles for sensemaking. Transient constructs help resolve the dynamic tension between stability and change in design processes. On the one hand, given their unfinished and makeshift character, they allow for variability, online experimentation, and cognitive transactions; on the other hand, they may occasionally coalesce into more stable and persistent structures, which are continuously reconfigured by a never ending activity of bricolage.",[],G.F Lanzara,lanzara@spbo.unibo.it,"Dipartimento di Organizzazione e Sistema Politico, Università di Bologna, Strada Maggiore 45, I-40125 Bologna, Italy"

In the face of a sluggish economy, corporate investment has been sluggish. Amid such a weak economy, investment in information technology (IT) has remained relatively strong, particularly in the telecommunications sector. The growth of the IT industry came along with the changes in its structure. Adoption of open architecture, greater use of packaged software, and increased popularity of outsourcing are examples. The adoption of open architecture in IT was in part a reflection of the openness of the systems that employed the technology. The Japanese industry that relied on close relations along the supply chain tended to maintain proprietary IT architecture within groups. The increasing power of the demand side has been instrumental in opening up the once closed supply chain and the IT infrastructure.",[],J Kokuryo,jkokuryo@mba1988.hbs.edu,"Graduate School of Business Administration, Keio University, 2-1-1 Hiyoshi-Honcho, Kohoku-ku, Yokohama 223, Japan"

The purpose of this case study was to examine the major obstacles facing a small firm engaging in global business-to-business electronic commerce and to offer some insights into how the small firm can effectively manoeuver in the global electronic market. Several important issues emerge from this study, including: (1) the importance of post-sales support; (2) the ability to physically grow globally; (3) the role of image in a virtual environment; and (4) the awareness of the primary client.

Today, in deregulated markets notably in Europe and especially the UK, traditionally separate industry sectors such as banking, insurance, housing finance and brokerage have become increasingly integrated since the late 1980s. In the USA and Japan regulation has prevented all these historically segregated sectors from integrating although the same patterns observable in Europe have attempted to emerge. In addition, around the world institutions such as retailers, brokerage houses and the like, not subject to the constraints of those officially licensed institutions such as banks and insurance companies, were free to add financial services to their product portfolios subject to certain constraints. As a result it is these new entrants which have often pioneered the development of new ways of providing traditional services with lower levels of cost but offering superior consumer quality. These innovations have almost invariably been driven by information technology.",[],Derek F.

A classification of success factors for decision support systems","Volume 7, Issue 1", Issue 1,"Whilst considerable experience in the design and development of decision support systems (DSS) has been accumulated, the expected benefits from these systems are often not realized. To help correct this deficiency the knowledge about the factors for success in consultant-led DSS development has been structured within a classification that has been motivated by three major considerations: the needed alignment between the DSS and the business requirements; the wide range of actors who play a role, both in the development of the DSS and in its continued used; and the two phases to DSS development whereby an appropriate environment for development is ensured and the commitment of the major actors is maintained as the required DSS is evolved. Field research was carried out to develop and validate the classification. The implementation of 39 DSS was reviewed in 27 organizations that together were using 22 DSS generators. 131 factors were verified in the field research as impacting on the successful implementation of DSS.

A classification of success factors for decision support systems","Volume 7, Issue 1", Issue 1,"Whilst considerable experience in the design and development of decision support systems (DSS) has been accumulated, the expected benefits from these systems are often not realized. To help correct this deficiency the knowledge about the factors for success in consultant-led DSS development has been structured within a classification that has been motivated by three major considerations: the needed alignment between the DSS and the business requirements; the wide range of actors who play a role, both in the development of the DSS and in its continued used; and the two phases to DSS development whereby an appropriate environment for development is ensured and the commitment of the major actors is maintained as the required DSS is evolved. Field research was carried out to develop and validate the classification. The implementation of 39 DSS was reviewed in 27 organizations that together were using 22 DSS generators. 131 factors were verified in the field research as impacting on the successful implementation of DSS. A second field research investigated the importance of these factors in one specific situation, and demonstrated the use of the classification in providing guidance to practitioners operating in similar contexts.",[],Morteza Forghani,N/A,"Loughborough University Business School, Ashby Road, Loughborough, Leicestershire LE11 3TU, UK"

The paper explains why strategic data planning is such a difficult undertaking and suggests three important implications for practitioners. First, both business managers and information systems staff find the output data architecture difficult to understand, and improved representations and explanations of the data architecture should be used. Second, strategic data planning is a complex social activity and an understanding of the organisational context within which it takes place is critical to its success.

The purpose of this paper is to offer an explanation for the perceived lack of IT payoff and show how managers can improve the return on their IT investments. We argue that IT can provide significant benefits, but in many cases these benefits are not captured by the firm that made the investment. Instead, a large portion of the benefits are reaped by a variety of participants or stakeholders. The implications of this for managers is that they need to view IT payoff as a portfolio of benefits across many stakeholders. They must also understand and manage the distribution of the benefits within the portfolio to assure that benefits are transferred to the bottom line. The paper offers a framework for analyzing the nature and distribution of IT benefits among various stakeholder groups and concludes with a set of guidelines for measuring and managing these benefits.",[],Jaak Jurison,N/A,"Information and Communications Systems, Fordham University, Graduate School of Business Administration, 113 West 60th Street, New York, NY 10023, USA"

Following changes in retailing and especially in the fashion industry, this chain has developed a strategic information system intended to improve its purchasing and distribution processes. The system, called FIPS (for ‘Fashion Information and Planning System’), is integrated with the company's warehouse management and financial planning functions. It consists of two main modules: the ‘Fashion Information System’ and the ‘Purchase Planning and Control’. The case study first reports on the business factors that led to the development of FIPS, the design features of the system, as well as its cost and benefits. It then discusses the organizational impact of the system, mainly in terms of IT-enabled innovative business procedures, changing functions and competencies within the company, and redefining the role of IT in the corporation.

Implementation strategies for office systems","Volume 4, Issue 3", Issue 3,"A technology implementation strategy must begin with identification of the potential benefits. Office information systems have generally been regarded as administrative support rather than as strategic systems. However, with advances in technical integration, office systems are developing from a rather narrow conception of ‘office automation’ into organization-wide systems which do have strategic significance. This paper draws on information-processing theory and other theoretical work on strategic applications of information technology and synthesizes it to develop a model showing four strategic roles for integrated office systems. These are illustrated with examples from the author's research. An implementation strategy must also consider the organizational implications and how to deal with them. Integrated systems have more organizational ‘impact’ than earlier departmental systems. In some cases, strategic office systems require extensive organization redesign. The relative advantages of alternative approaches to these questions are discussed, and it is argued that traditional methodologies need to be supplemented by a change management approach which can deal with second-order change, such as organizational transformation.",[],Faith Noble,N/A,"Sheffield Business School, Totley Hall Lane, Sheffield S17 4AB, UK"

However, there is increasing awareness that IOS are becoming a strategic necessity and that their organizational impact demands attention. Examples show that IOS offer opportunities for enhanced organizational design. At the same time, however, IOS lead to mutual dependence between participating organizations that potentially limits their adaptability. This makes management of relationships between IOS participants a key issue in establishing and managing successful IOS. To gain a better understanding of this issue, it is important to go beyond existing functional typologies of IOS. A framework of different contexts of IOS usage is presented that helps in assessing the importance of relationship management between different groups of IOS participants. The framework classifies IOS contexts along two dimensions. First, does the system give the user a competitive advantage, or is it a strategic necessity for participating in the industry? Second, is the system an adjunct to the IOS provider's primary product, or does it constitute a stand-alone business? The author concludes that trust between IOS participants is essential for successful IOS. Analyzing IOS from the perspective of relationship management yields potential win-win outcomes amid all the rhetoric about the competitive battlegrounds.",[],Johannes Meier,N/A,"McKinsey & Company, Inc, 31/F, Asia Pacific Finance Tower, Citibank Plaza, 3 Garden Road, Central, Hong Kong, China"

Electronic data interchange and power in the supply chain,"Volume 4, Issue 1", Issue 1,"This paper is concerned with the way in which the design and use of interorganizational information systems reflect the strategic interests of powerful corporate players and the struggles of those players for domination in the marketplace. The paper draws upon the insights developed within the sociology of technology, in which innovation is not simply a technical-rational process of ‘solving problems’; it also involves economic and political processes in articulating interests, building alliances and struggling over outcomes. To illustrate the way in which powerful users seek to have their interests articulated in information systems, the paper discusses the design and implementation of electronic data interchange in a major UK motor manufacturer, highlighting the economic, political and cultural factors which have conditioned the design and use of this system. It then sets these findings in the context of the automotive industry more broadly, and compares them with experiences in another sector, retailing. The paper concludes that the design and use of electronic trading networks are more strongly shaped by the competitive environment than by contemporary ‘popular’ management ideas.",[],Juliet Webster,N/A,"Department of Innovation Studies, University of East London, Maryland House, Manbey Park Road, London E15 1 EY, UK"

Problems encountered in information systems planning have been experienced by many companies for over 25 years. Although during this period the focus of planning has changed, some of the original problems (eg linkage between information systems strategy and business strategy) still exist. Until now, researchers in this area have tended to focus their attention on the development of information systems planning methods/methodologies. However, there is little evidence to suggest that these methods/methodologies are addressing some of the major issues (eg insufficient resources such as people, funds and computer time, failure in plan implementation) that have plagued information systems planning over the years with a view to improving ISP effectiveness. This paper argues that clarification is needed as to the scope of the information systems planning activity and suggests that a multi-dimensional perspective needs to be taken in order to improve information systems planning. It identifies a major component of information systems planning effectiveness which has had little attention paid to it in the past, namely feedback, and suggests ways in which to investigate whether a relationship exists between the presence/quality of these feedback mechanisms and planning effectiveness.",[],Bernadette Baker,N/A,"Information Systems Research Unit, University of Warwick Business School, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK"

The author argues that these approaches are similar in their procedures although, in her view, socio-technical design has a better theoretical basis and a stronger methodology. However, they differ greatly in their values. Socio-technical design argues that when new work systems are being designed equal weight should be given to social and technical factors.

This paper develops two frameworks to assess the level and nature of electronic trade integration within the context of a port community enterprise model. Port communities throughout the world are applying electronic data interchange (EDI) to trade functions because it enables open communications among many partners, provides acceptably quick communications for relatively low cost, and offers the prospect of significant savings in time and cost through reduced data capture volume and error-rates. EDI enables not only internal efficiencies but also the creation of new trade services. The first framework specifies the information systems and technology needed to enable EDI in international trade. The framework comprises two levels of infrastructure: communications and documentary; both supporting a third superstructure of business processes. Port communities are evolving from providing not only goods-handling facilities but offering advanced data-handling and processing systems as well. As competition between ports increases, information systems become key elements in their strategic positions. A second framework provides the structure for understanding physical and informational strategies of ports and port communities, and to examine their importance.

The empirical results arising from survey research conducted in the UK show that most businesses appear to be competing through new products in existing markets and the most popular information system is one which increases market share. For those firms whose strategy is to sell existing goods in existing markets, the results reveal that the most important contribution of IT/IS is considered to be enabling the reduction of costs. Whilst firms do use IT/IS in a strategic way, this is frequently undertaken for defensive reasons to maintain the firm's position in the industry. However, IT/IS strategies are also seen to support the general business strategy of product or market innovation. Recommendations for further research are also made, which focus on the potential bias introduced into this type of research where only IS managers are surveyed and business managers' views are not taken into account. This study has looked at only two models of business strategy and there is a need to extend the analysis to look at other models of business strategy, particularly Porter's.",[],M H Atkins,N/A,"Centre for Management Studies, University of Aberdeen, Edward Wright Building, Dunbar Street, Old Aberdeen AB92TY, UK"

The thrust of this work argues that the motives for investment in IT should derive from firm objectives and, more particularly, from the strategic plan which the organization wishes to pursue. This paper argues that, often, mere lip service is paid to the strategic nature of IT. Further, strategy justification has become a tool for securing investment in IT by circumventing established organizational policy on investments. Many IT investments labelled ‘strategic’ appear to be operational in nature. This paper discusses the nature and evaluation of strategy and relates it to the literature on IT as a strategic tool. The extent to which the relationship between IT and strategy has altered over recent years is subsequently investigated. The implementation process is investigated and evidence of IT investment activities and the returns available to investing organizations are reviewed. The paper argues that there are a number of alternative views on the IT-strategy relationship, some of which are organizationally detrimental.",[],Philip Powell,N/A,"Department of Accounting and Management Science, University of Southampton, Southampton SO9 5NH, UK"

As a result, current methods of measuring IS strategic planning success (or effectiveness) have come under scrutiny. A review of the IS planning literature shows that despite the availability of many different approaches for measuring IS strategic planning success, all have major limitations. The determinants of IS strategic planning success are still to be identified and valid measurement instruments are yet to be defined. The objective of this article, therefore, is to focus attention on the need for research into the measurement of IS strategic planning success. In addressing this aim, after clarifying the terminology to be used and outlining the significance of this problem, this paper reviews the IS planning effectiveness literature. Current approaches for measuring IS strategic planning success are examined and, based on this analysis, two frameworks relating to its measurement are presented. The first framework provides an outline of approaches currently available and the second proposes directions for future research.

A strategy for identifying ‘excellent’ systems analysts","Volume 2, Issue 1", Issue 1,"One of the key issues confronting information systems (IS) executives relates to the effectiveness and efficiency of their staff in actually implementing their organization's IS strategies. As a result of this and in the light of the current development and maintenance backlog problem and a desire to increase systems analyst productivity, a research project was initiated to identify the qualities of ‘excellent’ systems analysts. The project included 53 research participants from two companies representing five groups of individuals, or audiences, who interact with systems analysts. The data were gathered using Kelly's RepGrid technique and represent audience perceptions of what constitutes an ‘excellent’ systems analyst. Overall, the more important aspects that emerged from the data include communicate, attitude, knowledge, investigate, and experience. The detailed definitions of these aspects, as determined from the research data, varied among the audiences and reflected audience objectives. For instance, user audiences emphasized content-related aspects, such as knowledge. Alternatively, systems analysts and their supervisors differentiated on process-related aspects, such as investigate. Each audience has its own interpretation of the relative importance of what constitutes an ‘excellent’ systems analyst. Based on these research findings, the companies involved in the research project have revised their approach to hiring and training systems analysts.",[],M.Gordon Hunter,N/A,"School of Accountancy and Business, Nanyang Technological University, Nanyang Avenue, Singapore 2263"

Despite the fact that some have called centralized systems electronic dinosaurs, many companies are turning to this traditional approach because it does offer one thing that decentralized systems generally lack, namely, control. The results indicate that information technology structure (centralized vs. decentralized) is strongly related to management equity ownership and to concentration of stock holding. For example, an organization where top executives and managers own a relatively high percentage of the company's stock possesses a more centralized information technology structure than an organization with a relatively lower percentage of management ownership. This means that user departments in the latter have more control over their IT functions than users in the former. Conversely, companies with a high level of stock concentration have a more decentralized IT structure. In addition, the research revealed a statistically significant relationship between a company's equity to debt ratio and the level of IT centralization.",[],Zeinab A.

However in practice this linkage is not yet well established. It is the conventional wisdom that this linkage problem is solved by analysing the corporate strategy and integrating IS issues and solutions in this. This paper develops an alternative approach to IS and business strategy alignment, based on the observation that corporate strategy is either unknown or unadaptable once it is fixed. It argues, therefore, that ex post IS alignment will seldom be a success. The proposed approach is based on the current theoretical concepts in information management, links them in a framework, and integrates the process of corporate strategy definition with the process of IS strategy definition. However, it should be added that the resultant general alignment map will be different for different industry sectors.",[],Walter Baets,N/A,"Lovanium International Management Center, Chaussee de Bruxelles 135, 1310 La Hulpe, Belgium"

However internal sources also have limitations which affect their ability to supply adequate software. With software important in influencing the effectiveness of IT, limitations in both external and internal sources mean software acquisition decisions should be integral to formulating IT strategies. Meanwhile, specialization of the software sector into vertical markets since the late 1980s is possibly reducing its limitations, and exposing weaknesses in the tools available for making software acquisition decisions, particularly make/buy decisions. Lack of adequate tools for taking software make/buy decisions could affect firms' ability to use IT competitively where specialized software markets exist.",[],Tony Rands,N/A,"Fellow in Management Science and Information Systems, Templeton College, Oxford, UK"

A comparison between expert systems and ‘conventional’ fourth generation systems leads to a grouping of the advances attributed to expert systems into four classes: similarities masked by the different terminologies used; developments associated with expert systems that are not new; the unfolding IT scene; and those developments that can truly be associated with expert systems. The conclusion is that there is little new about expert systems. The contribution that expert systems might be expected to make to an organization's competitive position is then discussed within the more general context of IT as a whole. The contribution hinges on the sort of task that the expert system is supporting or carrying out. The conclusion is that it is only for novel/unique situations that IT can provide competitive advantage and this is rarely the province of expert systems.,[],Paul N.

(b) how should their development and implementation be managed? and (c) what do strategic systems really contribute to the company?
